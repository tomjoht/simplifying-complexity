## Summary of doc navigation principles

Here's a summary of the main design principles we covered:

  * Hierarchy
  * Progressive disclosure
  * Immersion
  * Desire Line
  * Modularity
  * Wayfinding

There are more principles of design that apply, but these are a good start and probably form the core of what you need to know.

### Avoid non-standard design

In conclusion, I want to caution away from non-standard design (except as an experiment). Users tend to expect sites to have a predictable, standard design to them, and if you implement "creative" navigation (such as by structuring all navigation through breadcrumbs, or making 3D navigation based on hotspots in a picture, etc.), you make it more difficult for people to use your site.

The following is an intersection near my house that has a bike crossing lane that runs kitty-corner, while the pedestrian crossing lanes bisect the street.

At least a quart of the time when I try to cross this intersection, drivers get confused. Sometimes they drive half way through the intersection and then stop. I often see surprise on the drivers' faces as they realize, mid-way through, that they've just screwed up. This design violates what users have come to expect. While the design may have seemed like a neat idea, it doesn't work in practice because drivers are used to other patterns.

When we follow universal design principles, we conform to the behaviors and patterns that work well with users. Our navigation features won't call attention to themselves but will rather invisibly support the main purpose of the help, which is to allow users to find and focus on content.
