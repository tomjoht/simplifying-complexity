## Action 4: Make popular topics easy to access

In addition to using inline links, I also wanted to surface the most popular topics in more visible, easy-to-find places. For example, one of the most popular topics was information on specifications. Based on metrics analysis, it seemed that of all topics in the help, this was the one most people were viewing.

I moved this topic up more prominently in the help by listing it immediately after the overview, linking to it on the overview page, and featuring it on the doc portal homepage.

### Design principle: Desire line

The design principle here is one called "Desire line." Desire lines are the natural paths that form based on frequent user preferences.

The most common example of a desire line is a shortcut across a lawn.

A desire line is the most common path a user takes through a system. For example, if you were to design a park, rather than starting out with fixed paths, you could instead let paths form naturally based on where people wanted to walk, and then later cement these dirt paths in. (This is how the designers created the walking paths at Central Park.)

In your help system, you probably have a list of popular topics that make up the bulk of search results (following the [80/20 rule](http://idratherbewriting.com/2012/04/17/leveraging-the-wisdom-of-the-8020-rule-focusing-on-content-that-matters/)). Make these topics prominent and easy to click on your entry point, reducing the user's ability to find and view these topics.

Here's an example from Twitter. By putting the most popular topics right at the top, the authors embrace the desire lines to these topics.

On the [Amazon Developer Documentation homepage](https://developer.amazon.com/documentation), we looked at the top 10 most viewed topics in our help and made this content visually prominent in a carousel at the top.

It's nearly impossible to identify your desire lines without diving into metrics, so don't just guess. Start with quantitative data about what pages users are actually searching for. The results might surprise you.

You can take desire lines a step further by dedicating more time to content development for those pages. If this small number of pages accounts for the bulk of your user's viewing time, spend more time developing, expanding, and testing the content on those pages.

## Action 5: Reduce information fragmentation

Another action I took to help tackle findability issues was to consolidate information into longer, more complete pages where necessary. Fortunately, with this help system, short, fragmented content wasn't a huge issue, but as I developed new content, I conscientiously avoided splitting up content when it could be consolidated in a readable way on the same page.

For example, the following is a screenshot of a topic on customizing the appearance of your app. There were various ways to customize the app, and I could have broken each element into its own topic (for example, change the logo, change the background color, change the layout, etc.). Instead, I decided to put all the content on the same page, making it navigable through an on-page table of contents (TOC).

The longer pages you have, the more imperative the on-page TOC becomes for enabling users to navigate the information on that page.
