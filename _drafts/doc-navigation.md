I think this content is just duplicate from the same directory where the doc navigation WTD presentation content lives.


This site contains information that I'm currently developing. It's a work in progress.

## Where the problem first surfaced

If you've ever had the opportunity to watch someone use your documentation in a lab, but it can be pretty eye-opening. A few years ago I worked at a company that had a usability lab. It was actually left over from the previous company that inhabited the building. At some point our company formed a usability team and started to do some testing in the room.

Usability labs are set up similar to interrogation rooms, with one-way mirrored glass separating two rooms. On one side, the participant uses a computer, often following prompts from a usability tester. In the other room, behind the mirrored glass, the designers, engineers, program managers, and other stakeholders eagerly watch the participants fumble and act like "idiots."

When I heard about these tests, I persuaded our usability tester to push users into my documentation so we could evaluate their effectiveness. The tester would ask users to do a difficult task, a task they wouldn't be able to figure out from the interface on their own. Eventually the user either clicked the help or, more commonly, the usability tester suggested they look in the help for the answer.

(Actually, the user would often draw a blank with the task. The usability tester would ask, Where can you find help that would give you more information about this? Users would continue with the blank stare. The usability tester would then ask, Could the documentation be helpful in finding this information? A light would then go on in the user's head. Watching this scenario unfold was truly mind-boggling.)

After the users forayed into the help, they began a meandering path of poking around, skimming, scanning, browsing, reading here and there, and generally not finding their answers. I wrote about these [general observations here](https://idratherbewriting.com/2011/07/22/a-few-notes-from-usability-testing-video-tutorials-get-watched-text-gets-skipped/). Different users prefer different types of content, and they have different ways of consuming the information (new users watch videos, advanced users skim and scan text). But they all have one thing in common: both spend most of their time looking for the right answer only to not find it, and eventually they give up.

Granted, we didn't have more than half a dozen participants, but it seemed rare that a user would actually found the answer in the help. They click links, scroll, hunt around in studious ways, and regularly fails to see the answer when they were staring right at it on the page.

This experience helped me realize one of the biggest challenges in documentation: helping users find the right answer amid a sea of documentation topics. We spend a lot of time developing clear, accurate information, but if users can't find it, that information does them no good.

We don't sink nearly enough time into solving issues of findability in documentation. Perhaps we're too busy writing the information or reviewing it with engineers to consider that users may never actually find what we're so diligently creating.

## New company ... same problem

The idea that users can't find info in docs (assuming that the info exists) isn't an isolated or unique problem. The findability problem addresses the core of what it means to create documentation. A few years later I started working at another company only to run into the same findability issues. (I'm sure the problem continued regularly at every company I've worked at, but I didn't always have access to observe or gather info from users, so I generally didn't know. Tech writers usually operate in the dark about how their information product (the documentation) is used &mdash; this mindset allows tech writers to continue believing in higher purpose of their undervalued work.)

In this new go-around, the company had hired a third party to evaluate the product and its documentation. And this time the audience consisted of developers creating apps, not end users interacting with a user interface. Unsurprisingly, the users reported difficulty in finding the information.

Granted, there were a lot of issues with the product, and the studies weren't targeted at just evaluating the docs. Users complained about information being circular and redundant in places, being poorly organized. Not being able to locate the right information again surfaced in their myriad complaints. It seems the findability problem just wouldn't go away.

How can we help users find what they're looking for in our documentation? How can we eradicate this problem once and for all so that users can locate the right information quickly and efficiently, without so much hunting, scrolling, and fruitless searching?

## Starting points with design

When thinking about strategies for navigation within your documentation, it's helpful to start with some design principles that have already been developed and studied, even if the design principles weren't necessarily formulated in documentation or information scenarios. This is especially necessary because there isn't ample tech comm research about navigation patterns within documentation.

In the book [Universal Principles of Design](https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Principles-Design-Revised-Updated/dp/1592535879/ref=pd_lpo_sbs_14_img_0?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1&refRID=Z3N8PRGT94SFH1Z5765N), the authors explore design principles that they feel are universal and which apply across a wide variety of industries, products, and scenarios. The book provides concise summaries about a range of design topics.

From 125 separate design principles, there are a handful of design principles that I think have particular relevance to document navigation. The core principles include the following:

* Hierarchy
* Progressive disclosure
* Immersion
* Desire line
* Modularity
* Wayfinding

Applying these principles in the way we design our docs can create a better experience for users, both in their ability to find and navigate information.

Rather than just discussing these principles abstractly, I'll explain how I tried to improve my docs be applying these design principles to the content.
