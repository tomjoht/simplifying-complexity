Looking at trends tells us that specialized knowledge is frequently in demand in technical writing roles. To write about complex topics, you usually need some knowledge of the topic. You might not have as much knowledge as a subject matter expert, who could be an engineer working in the code all day, but your knowledge has to go beyond the shallowness of a generalist. Without knowledge and understanding of the subject (even if not thorough or at the level of an engineer), you can't develop content; you can only edit and publish content and work beside others who have that knowledge. That said, technical writers are responsible for too many aspects of content and technical categories to develop specialized knowledge in a subject domain that competes with an engineers' knowledge. At most, technical writers can develop technical aptitude and try to learn what they need to know for each product and documentation scenario, and also collaborate with engineers to fill in the gaps.

## Looking at trends

In a rapidly changing field like technology, almost everything is in constant flux. Sometimes you wake up and so much seems to have changed. Consider how some previously dominant companies simply vanished: Blackberry, Blockbuster, Borders Books, Toys 'R' Us, Kodak, Radio Shack, Tower Records, Circuit City, Encyclopedia Britannica, and others.

Some these companies fizzled because they focused only on what helped make them successful and became blind to further innovation after achieving success. They also focused too much on the market today rather than the one forming tomorrow (see [Companies That Went Bankrupt From Innovation Lag](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072115/companies-went-bankrupt-innovation-lag.asp)).

These are companies not job roles or functions. But I think the same might be same of technical writing professions. Look at the constant evolution of ideas in tech comm discipline. At the turn of the century, we moved from PDF to web formats, then gradually to DITA and the semantic web. Then wikis became popular, and the idea that everyone could be a contributing tech writer flourished. Then one day wikis (and the myth of crowdsourced docs) died, and YouTube took the spotlight on the Internet. Soon people began saying that all documentation was going to consist of YouTube videos because this is how millennials learn.

Videos didn't displace the written format, though they did become much more common. In the next turn of the wheel of time, Content Strategy reared its head. Almost overnight, many in the tech comm community started calling themselves "content strategists" of one kind or another. Then after a few years, content strategy started to become synonymous with SEO copywriting.

A few years later, chatbots took the center stage. Entire conferences were organized around chatbots, and many felt this was the future of documentation. All documentation, it seemed, would need to be chunked into small units that could be relayed and spoken by chatbots and other voice-integrated devices. Then chatbots sort of lost the spotlight. Now docs-as-code tools seems to be getting the most attention, as tech pubs follows the directions of software engineers in the way they approach doc publishing.

Ideas and technologies come and go. How do you know whether a trend today will be the norm tomorrow, or whether the trend will just fizzle out?

We pay attention to trends in part out of curiosity, but also to stay relevant. We don't want to wake up one day, perhaps after being laid off and unable to find new work, and ask in a surprised, perplexed way, "What happened?" We want to avoid being caught off guard in becoming professionally unmarketable.

But discerning trends from fads is not an easy task. Understanding whether trends will become the norm requires us to investigate the evidence for the trend. What data supports the idea behind a trend? How can you separate whether a trend is merely some new and shiny tech toy, or whether it's a bona fide direction that the technology landscape has taken? When Blockbuster looked at the emergence of streaming online video, or when Kodak looked at digital photo formats, did they dismiss these trends as fads? How do you know whether to align yourself with trends to to ignore them?

Fortunately, we do have access to evidence to make decisions about trends. In the following sections, I'll make that case that desired skills in job advertisements can provide a more stable, reliable barometer for trends. One constant in job descriptions is the requirement for technical writers to possess somewhat specialized technical knowledge from the start.

Without more specialized knowledge, it can be nearly impossible to understand, unravel, and articulate the details of a complex subject. If you're writing UX copy for end-user applications, or providing content for mainstream end users rather than engineers, this more specialized knowledge might not be essential. But for areas of complexity, which is what this series focuses on, you need a deeper understanding. The degree to which you can participate in the *authoring* &mdash; as opposed to just editing or publishing &mdash; depends on how much you know about the subject.

## The impact of UX and the need for documentation

We need a starting point for this discussion, so let's begin by analyzing the impact of UX design on tech comm. In a recent episode of the Cherryleaf podcast, [40. The evolution of the technical communicator’s career](https://cherryleaf.podbean.com/e/the-evolution-of-technical-communication/), Ellis Pratt discusses an article called [Software technical writing is a dying career (but here’s what writers can do to stay in the software game)](https://softwaresaltmines.com/2015/06/16/software-technical-writing-dying/), by Jim Grey published in 2015.

Grey’s main argument is that "companies are leaning into good user-interface design and stepping away from online Help systems and printed/PDF documentation." Grey explains that he had lunch with a business owner who explained this transition, saying:

> Technical writing is dying off.... It’s all about clean, engaging UX now. I have talked to more than a hundred startup and small software companies as I’ve built my business. Almost none of them have technical writers, and almost all of them have UX designers.

Grey argues that UX design has displaced the need for tech comm in software companies. Instead of hiring a tech writer to provide explanations for confusing interfaces, companies hire UX designers to get the design intuitive from the start.

{% include course_image.html size="large" filename="generalist_specialist_design_not_docs" ext_print="svg" ext_web="svg" alt="Grey says the trend, at least for end-user products, is to hire UX designers to create intuitive products that don't need documentation" caption="Grey says the trend, at least for end-user products, is to hire UX designers to create intuitive products that don't need documentation" %}

Keep in mind this was a simple blog post. [Grey has noted](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/10/02/providing-value-as-generalists-in-specialist-contexts-part-2/#comment-4128781619) that he "wasn't trying to write a well-researched article for the ages." Even it was only a simple blog post, Grey stood by his argument. Sensing his irrelevance as a technical writer, Grey jumped off the documentation ship and into software testing instead, where he says he brought along many useful skills he learned as a technical writer.

Undeniably, the practice of user experience design has matured into a full-fledged discipline rich with research-backed design principles, methodology, and professional expertise. UX designers are now much more common in engineering groups. Companies recognize that usable interfaces can make the difference between product success and failure. Companies like Apple have cemented the idea that users are willing to pay for well-designed products that don't rely on a lot of documentation.  

UX has championed this emphasis on the user experience. But does it mean companies are eliminating tech writers from their organizations?

Not necessarily. Some commenters in a [previous survey](https://www.questionpro.com/t/PESakZc1sh) noted that many UX designers see good copywriting as part of UX and will often champion the inclusion of technical writers in the design process. One respondent noted:

> Effective writing that makes processes simple to follow *is* one part of good UX, not separate. Unless UX design roles demand writing skills, I don't expect technical writing roles to disappear. In the last five years, UX designers have probably been more effective at advocating for their discipline and inserting themselves within developer-led discussions than technical writers have.

In other words, rather than remove writers from the equation, UX designers become advocates of good writing, increasing the involvement of tech writers in UX (especially when designers lack writing skills themselves). For some tech writers, their primary role is, in fact, "UX copywriting." For others, UX writing is just one aspect of their role among many other types of work.

The latter is true for me. I occasionally work with a design team in my current role. They create design mocks, and they ask me to review the text. I provide detailed feedback that covers every aspect of text in the UI, from button labels to microcopy, dialog box text, error messages, and more.

However, I don't do a lot of UX copywriting (maybe once a month), since we have a small design team and they don't crank out new user interfaces too often. But without the UX team, I'm not sure I would be regularly included in these UI writing efforts. In this case, UX has increased my role rather than taken it away.

On the other hand, without the UX design team, I'm sure the user interface that the engineers (without UX skills) might create would be so bad that I'd be called in with great urgency to provide more detailed explanations, even video tutorials walking users through the confusing process. So whether UX has a positive or negative influence on my need within teams is somewhat uncertain to me.

## Evaluating trends based on tech comm job data

Was Grey right or wrong? So far, I haven't presented any data. It's easy to trade anecdote for anecdote, but what does the data say about tech comm jobs? Are they diminishing? If so, why? Let's dive into some data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).

If you look at the latest [STC Salary Database](https://www.stc.org/salary-database/) (based on BLS data), you can see that tech writing jobs have actually grown by about 3,620 jobs in 4 years:

{% include course_image.html url="https://www.stc.org/salary-database/" size="" border="" filename="techwriterjobsovertime" ext_print="png" ext_web="png" alt="Tech writing jobs have grown slightly since 2012, up by about 3,620 jobs." caption="Tech writing jobs have grown slightly since 2012, up by about 3,620 jobs." %}

Overall, in 2016, there were about 50,000 technical writing jobs in the United States. The report notes that technical writing is "the only occupation [among professional writing disciplines] which has seen employment growth in each year since 2011, with an average annual employment increase of 1.9%."

Despite the growth, technical writing jobs aren't necessarily keeping pace with software development jobs. The BLS says the [job growth for software developers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) from 2016 to 2026 is projected at 24%, but for [technical writers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/technical-writers.htm), the job growth is projected at just 11%. (Both growth rates are higher than the national average, which is 7%.)

To put these numbers into perspective, suppose 10 technical writers support 1,000 engineers. In 2026, **11** technical writers will support **1,240** engineers. If the rate stays the same for the next decade, in 2036, **12** technical writers will support **1,538** engineers.

So yeah, while technical writing jobs might not be diminishing, they are shrinking proportionally. Or else they are diversifying with more diverse titles that are harder to track. But as far as measuring the impact of UX or other causes affecting the job growth, the BLS has little to say except this:

> Employment growth will be driven by the continuing expansion of scientific and technical products. An increase in Web-based product support should also increase demand for technical writers. Job opportunities, especially for applicants with technical skills, are expected to be good.

This last point &mdash; "especially for applicants with technical skills" &mdash; is something I'll return to later since there has been a continual requirement for subject-matter familiarity in job advertisements.

## An "evolution" of roles, but evolving towards what?

What does Pratt make of Grey's blog post? In the podcast, Pratt looks generally at job trends and decides that no, technical writing jobs haven’t gone away. Pratt's company, Cherryleaf, is primarily a recruiting agency for technical writers, so the mere fact that he's still in business suggests that companies are still seeking technical writers.

But Pratt does make another point. He says:

> Is this true? Has the tech writing job disappeared since 2015? Clearly not, because there are still … [many] technical writers and authors. But I think there is a truth in saying that the role of the technical author is changing, and the requirements and the skills that they need are changing as well. And it may be that the job title changes and the way in which the role is perceived.  

In other words, he says the jobs haven’t disappeared, but the _roles, requirements, and skills have evolved_. In a [survey in a previous post](https://www.questionpro.com/t/PESakZc1sh), I asked readers to state their level of agreement with the following:

> Technical writing jobs haven't diminished, but the profession is evolving.

{% include course_image.html url="https://www.questionpro.com/t/PESakZc1sh" filename="surveyrolesevolving" ext_print="png" ext_web="png" alt="Survey agreement" %}

Of the 65 respondents, about 53% of readers agree and 39% strongly agree with this statement (for a total of 92% agreement). But beyond the general role, requirements, and skills, exactly *what* is evolving in tech comm? Are we changing in positive ways to align with tomorrow's needs? More importantly, what kind of data supports this assertion about the evolution of the profession? We need to get much more specific here if our analysis of trends will be useful.

## Looking at job advertisements to extrapolate the evolution of tech comm

To get a better picture of the role, requirements, and skills in demand, let's turn to some research based on an analysis of job advertisements. In "The Evolution of Technical Communication: An Analysis of Industry Job Postings" (Nov 2015 *Technical Communication Journal*), Eva Brumberger and Claire Lauer say that by looking for patterns in job advertisements, you can see what employers are looking for and hence learn what skills and needs are trending in the industry. They write:

> Job advertisements, as a genre, have the specific purpose of hiring an employee for a company or organization, so they typically include consistent kinds of descriptive information that can serve as a barometer of industry trends when studied over years and even decades.

In other words, if you want to know real trends, look at what employers are writing in job descriptions for the candidates they want to hire. After analyzing about 1,000 job postings (which appeared during a 60-day period in late 2013), what did Brumberger and Lauer find? They found that the job ads painted a picture far more diverse than the BLS's simplistic description of the technical writer occupation. The authors noted the incredible variety of roles and deliverables that tech comm professionals are engaged in.

However, part of this diversity is a result of Brumberger and Lauer's broad focus on job technical communication titles and categories. Some of the job titles included "Social Media Manager," "Front End Developer," "Web Content Analyst," "UI Designer," "Grant writer," "Medical writer," and more. They excluded job ads that focused exclusively on a technical tool or framework with no rhetorical role in communication. They also divided the job postings into five main categories: Content Developer/Manager, Grant/Proposal Writer, Medical Writer, Social Media Writer, and Technical Writer/Editor. Given this wide tech comm net they cast, it comes as little surprise that they would find tech comm professionals engaged in such a variety of work.

Although this wide scope is probably appropriate for a tech comm program, my interests relate mostly to technical writing, so I'm going to narrow my focus on this "technical writer/editor" category in Brumberger and Lauer's study.

52% of Brumberger and Lauer's analyzed job ads fall within the technical writer/editor category. Within technical writer/editor jobs, 26% of the advertisements are for IT services/software, followed by 18% in professional and business services. The greatest job concentrations for technical writers/editors are on the east or west coast. About 85% of what technical writers/editors produce are user guides/tech docs, 13% web content, 13% video content or multimedia, and 19% reports.

The most sought-after professional competencies for technical writers/editors include written communication (75%), Editing (51%), Project planning/mgmt (49%), Visual communication (49%), Subject-matter familiarity (45%), Working with SMEs (41%), and Style guides/standards (40%). They note:

> Overall, written communication continues to dominate the technical communication landscape, but our data emphasize that several additional professional competencies are also essential, most notably project management, editing, visual communication, research, and, as Lanier (2009) noted, subject matter familiarity.

Commenting on overall trends across the job categories, the researchers observe the need to push content across multiple channels while adhering to brand, and the need to build relationships with customers through content.

The authors also deliberate about whether it's a good idea to specialize with more subject matter familiarity. They say this familiarity is particularly relevant in technical writer/editor job categories. Given the broad range of skills, roles, and deliverables within the umbrella of technical communication, the authors argue that remaining a jack-of-all-trades generalist would give you a lot of mobility and versatility within the field, empowering you with capabilities in a lot of different roles and functions. However, they acknowledge that others see specialized knowledge as being more valuable. The authors explain the view from another research study:

> Baehr (2015) [who studied perceptions of 8 tech comm managers] noted that this [specialization] was a point on which managerial perceptions varied; some participants felt that a broad skillset would “permit technical communicators to be more agile, adaptable, and flexible in their roles and to add greater value to organizations,” while others believed that specialization was “inevitable” (p. 116). Baehr concluded that the best course of action would be to develop multiple specializations, which would “enable technical communicators to define their own roles, to a certain extent” (p. 116). Our data suggest that there are several points of overlap in products and competencies, which could allow some degree of movement among job categories &mdash; or multiple specializations &mdash; if one maintains a broad skillset and flexible outlook.

In other words, the authors acknowledge that remaining a generalist would give you more mobility within the technical communication profession (leading to more "movement among job categories"), but they recommend multiple specializations as well, especially where the specializations might strategically overlap into multiple roles.

Baehr's research differs from Brumberger and Lauer's in that he didn't analyze job ads but rather interviewed a small handful of experts that are part of STC's Advisory Council to gather insights and perspectives. Nevertheless, his end goal was largely the same. He wanted to pinpoint what skills define the core identity in the tech comm profession. Baehr says that specializations related to "information design, knowledge management, and information architecture" tend to be most common, "while others such as interface design, usability, and user experience design were considered important, but weighed differently in organizational contexts."

In this light, Baehr's idea of "specialization" refers more to ancillary tech comm skills (e.g., information architecture) rather than subject matter familiarity with, say, a particular programming knowledge or industry, such as networking or finance. Thus this discussion about specialization and subject matter familiarity might not be focused on the same definitions.

Baehr argues that "breadth of specializations" define the core identity of technical communicators. He concludes that "successful technical communicators adapt to fit the mold of what is needed." The phrase "breadth of specializations" is somewhat of a paradox, since specialization usually refers to a narrow set of deep skills. With this phrase, he seems to be arguing for a broad set of specialized knowledge.

The decision about whether to specialize or not seems to be mixed. If you decide to pour all your efforts into, say, learning Python, you might be well-suited for roles documenting Python-related APIs and SDKs, but beyond that, your skills will likely run shallow. In other words, you would be really qualified for the 2 Python documentation jobs but not so qualified for the 30 other technical writing roles that have nothing to do with Python and more that require knowledge of information design, information architecture, localization, and more.

If we compare a similar job advertisement analysis done seven years earlier by Clinton Lanier ("Analysis of the Skills Called for by Technical Communication Employers in Recruitment Postings," published in February 2009 in *Technical Communication Journal*), can we see any trends with criteria for subject matter familiarity?

Lanier analyzed 327 job postings in 2006, limiting the scope to jobs with "technical writer" in the title and that required two years of experience or less only (which would thus be most suitable for graduating students to apply for). Regarding subject matter familiarity, Lanier found the following:

> ... 112 of the postings (34%) required or desired the potential writer to have experience writing about the specific subject matter that the current job involves. [For example], if the candidate was applying for a software documentation job in which they were going to be writing application programming interfaces (APIs) or online help, many of the positions required or desired that they have written such types of documents for the related types of subject matter.

In other words, employers have been seeking subject matter familiarity among job applicants in a consistent way at least since 2006. Even for job postings requiring just two years of experience or less (almost entry-level positions), 34% of employers want the candidate to have subject matter familiarity.

Lanier even supports the need for specialization with other research, explaining:

> This reflects the trend that technical communication is moving away from a “Jack of all trades” model, where technical writing is a very generalized concept, and toward a model that is more specialized and contextually defined. Giammona (2004) likewise found participants stating that new writers would benefit from experience within the industry they are going to write for, and Kim and Tolley (2004) related the story of a writer whose supervisor found the participant’s background in science more important than her knowledge of computing.

Given that Lanier restricts his data set to jobs requiring 2 years or less of experience, it's hard to compare the data set with Brumberger and Lauer's. However, 34% in 2006 and 45% in 2013 suggests a constant emphasis on subject matter familiarity. Deciding to specialize in a particular engineering domain wouldn't be considered a *new* trend, but its consistency for the past 15 years suggests that it's an ongoing requirement.

## Specialization for senior level only?

Whether to specialize or not seems to draw mixed reactions. It could be that both views are right but refer to different points in a career.

In a *Content Strategy* podcast episode focusing on information architecture (IA) and content strategy, IA professional Abby Covert says that junior IA positions are more generalist while senior IA positions can be specialized. The host Kristina Halvorson "What obstacles and opportunities are you seeing in a matured discipline like IA?" Covert responds:

> [For those wanting to enter IA,] there's a real industry pressure to generalize your practice as opposed to specialize your practice. There's a very large contingent of companies who are hiring or programs in existence that will push someone that has interest in IA towards becoming a UX generalist &mdash; where they're doing visual design, they're doing prototyping, they're doing research, they're doing content strategy, they're doing information architecture.
>
> All of those things are important for [...] a career in IA. But when you get into the hiring world, companies want people that are, for lack of a better word, the unicorns, people that can do all of that, and can do all of it really well at that mid-to-senior level.
>
> What I see more often than not is people saying, "I really want to be an IA, I just don't know how to make money *just* doing that." Companies just aren't hiring just that. So we have a real chasm. There's a bunch of senior people that have IA specific roles, but the role of junior information architect is something that our community really struggles with, whether or not it even exists.
>
> ... In terms of information architecture, one of the things you have to be really comfortable with is complexity, and to throw someone who has very little experience and only a theoretical knowledge of dealing with complexity at actual complexity, is a risk, and a lot of organizations are not willing to take that risk with hiring completely green juniors into those roles.
>
> So I'm really seeing a misbalance of information architecture as a specialty being only those that are in the mid or senior levels of their career. Which I think is challenging because it's kind of like "Hey kid, I know you really want to be in IA, wait 5-7 years as a generalist and maybe you can be." ([Ep. 10: Information Architecture, Content Strategy...](h))

In other words, when you're starting out in IA, you don't focus exclusively on IA but rather play a UX generalist role. Only after you've accrued 5-7 years of experience does your role gravitate more exclusively on IA tasks.

The same pattern might apply to tech comm roles. When you're new to the field, you work on a wide variety of documentation-related tasks that define the generalist's breadth of skills. You might work on UI copy, reports, documentation for new features, presentations, analytics, blog posts, edits of existing topics, SEO, doc site design, and more. But as you become more experienced, you might focus exclusively on revamping the doc publishing system, or in producing a lengthy e-learning system, or creating API documentation, etc. You could become even more specialized &mdash; migrating thousands of pages to DITA from unstructured FrameMaker, implementing Swagger UI custom skins, or documenting Java programming SDKs.

Overall, what do we make of this debate about whether to be a specialist or generalist? It seems that there's quite a lot of debate on both sides. But when I surveyed readers to provide agreement/disagreement to this question:

> Subject matter familiarity is a key requirement in a lot of the tech comm jobs I've looked at. It seems employers often want me to know X, Y, and Z technologies already from the start.

50% agreed, 24% strongly agreed, and 13% were undecided. I think it's safe to say that employers are looking for tech writers who have all the skills they need &mdash; specialized knowledge *and* writing skills that span across categories and rhetorical situations, and more.

Because of this need for strong technical knowledge, [James Neiman](http://drjamesneiman.com/), an experienced API technical writer, says that tech writers need engineering backgrounds, such as a computer science degree or previous experience as an engineer to excel in API documentation roles. Neiman says tech writers often need to look over a developer's shoulder, watching the developer code or listening to an engineer's brief 15-minute explanation, and then return to their desks to create the documentation. He says you might need to take the code examples in Java and produce equivalent samples in another language, such as C++, all on your own.

Take a look at this video of Neiman and [Andrew Davis](http://www.synergistech.com/) (a recruiter for API tech writers in the Bay area) presenting on [Finding the right API Technical Writer](https://youtu.be/lmNHBg20ql0?t=1314) at an API conference in London. Their presentation format includes a Q&A exchange between the two. Scrub to around the 22-minute mark for the relevant part:

{% if site.format == "web" %}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmNHBg20ql0?t=1314" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{% endif %}

Here's a transcript of the exchange:

> **Andrew**: Can a tech writer without a development background write great API documentation?
>
> **James**: Absolutely not. There is no way that a busy engineering team has time to train a person without a computer science degree. That's just the reality of it. Engineers at best can speak to you in some version of English, which may or may not be their native language. They don't have a lot of time, and they expect you to finish their thoughts for them. That means that you need to be able to sit next to them and look at how they're coding, and then be able to replicate that and extend it and even create examples.
>
> They may say, "Here's an example. You can extend it, add on these other APIs, work out this use case for us. We haven't had time to finish this." They can say, "Well, let me show you how this works in Objective C; we also support this on Java. Can you create something similar on Java?"
>
> If you don't have that kind of development background, it's unrealistic that you could expect to train, for example, somebody with a master's degree in English (and who is a very intelligent person but otherwise not technical) to do such a thing.

The focus here is on API documentation for developers, but I think a similar case could be made for other specialized engineering domains, from airplane maintenance procedures to pharmaceutical testing algorithms.

##  The full-stack technical writer

Despite the advantages of possessing specialized knowledge, there is a cost. It takes a lot of time to accrue this knowledge, and that time cost means neglect in other areas. James Rhea, in response to my post on [Generalist versus Specialist](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/12/20/changing-roles-of-technical-writers/), says that “adequate” technical knowledge is usually enough to get the job done, and acquiring deeper technical knowledge has somewhat diminishing returns, since it means other aspects of documentation will likely be neglected. Rhea writes:

> I wouldn’t aim for deep technical knowledge. I would aim for adequate technical knowledge, recognizing that what constitutes adequacy may vary by project, and that technical knowledge ought to grow over time due to immersion in the documentation and exposure to the technology and the industry.
>
> I speculate that the need for writers to have deep technical knowledge diminishes as Tech Comm teams grow in size and as other skills become more important than they are for smaller Tech Comm teams. I’m not claiming that deep technical knowledge is useless. I’m suggesting that (to frame it negatively) neglecting deep technical knowledge has less severe consequences than neglecting content curation, doc tool set, or workflow considerations. (Adding Value as a Technical Writer)

In other words, if you spend excessive amounts of time learning to code, at the expense of tending to other documentation tasks such as shaping information architecture, analyzing user metrics, overseeing translation workflows, developing user personas, developing glossaries, and more, your doc’s technical content might improve a bit, but the overall doc site will go downhill.

Additionally, while engineers can fill in the deep technical knowledge needed, no one will provide the tech comm tasks in place of a tech writer. As evidence, just look at any corporate wiki. Corporate wikis are prime examples of what happens when engineers (or other non-tech writers) write and publish documentation. Some pages might be rich with technical detail, but the degree of ROT (redundant, outdated, trivial content) gets compounded, navigation suffers, clarity gets muddled, and almost no one can find anything.

Additionally, even in engineering realms, generalist skills are welcome. A "full-stack developer" is someone who has the knowledge and skills to navigate all the technology layers in the stack &mdash; both front-end, backend, servers, and more. There is some debate about the level of knowledge a full-stack developer possesses, but according to Codeup,

> a full-stack developer is simply someone who is familiar with all layers in computer software development. These developers aren’t experts at everything; they simply have a functional knowledge and ability to take a concept and turn it into a finished product. Such gurus make building software much easier as they understand how everything works from top to bottom and can anticipate problems accordingly. In our opinion, this is the most realistic definition of a full-stack developer.
>
> Often times,  this class of developers stems from start-up environments, where a vast knowledge of all facets of web development is essential for a business’ survival.
>
> Clearly, it takes years of work experience in different languages, roles, and industries to reach this level of qualification. Because of this, full stack developers are few and far between, making those who exist very employable and in-demand. ("What is a Full-Stack Developer?")

This skillset category flips the tables on the hierarchy of specialists versus generalists. Here the generalist is in high-demand, especially in start-up environments where employees often wear multiple hats. A "full-stack" technical writer might not just be responsible for creating the documentation, but also responsible for the doc toolchain and publishing system (requiring skills in HTML, CSS, JS, and publishing workflows that might involve Git, continuous deployment, and verification scripts), support systems and forums, e-learning and video creation, blog posts and marketing content such as white papers, information architecture to establish taxonomies around terminology and flow, and more. This is the equivalent of the "full-stack" technical writer.

So the degree to which generalist skills are needed depends on the size of your company, and whether these other functions are covered by other specialists already.

## Technical knowledge valued more than writing skills

One of the recurring themes in this world of specialized knowledge is the devaluation of writing skills as a specialized skill set.

Imagine for a moment that you're a hiring manager. You have two candidates for a tech writing position: a former engineer who has a strong technical background but little writing experience, and an experienced writer who has a veteran track record and extensive portfolio but is new to the technology domain for the project. Who do you hire?

When I've been in situations like this, I've seen hiring managers (especially those from engineering backgrounds) choose the one with stronger technical skills and weaker writing skills. As long as the writing isn't red-flag poor, hiring managers are willing to overlook more advanced writing skills.

In a recent post in the technical writing forum on Reddit, a user commented:

> I work in engineering documentation, so I would always choose a candidate that has solid domain expertise even if they only have adequate writing skills. It's easier to train the writing skills than teach the domain expertise. ("How much weight does a certificate in technical writing carry?")

This sentiment is fairly common, especially among engineers. Coming back to Lanier's research, he noted that most job advertisements explicitly sought specialized skills more than they sought writing skills. Lanier explains:

> ... it was a bit surprising to see the low number of postings calling for these technical writing specific skills (17%). After reading the articles discussed above, my assumption was that the request for these skills would be present in a large majority of the postings, but this was not the case. Again there seems to be a trend by employers to want specialized skills, evident by the larger number of postings asking for familiarity with the specific types of documents they work with (24%).

In other words, the job advertisements had a surprisingly low number of requests for technical writing specific skills (just 17%); instead, they focused more on the need for specialized knowledge skills (24%). Ellis Pratt notes that this might be due to the difficulty of quantifying and measuring writing skills. For example, it's easy to check boxes if a candidate knows X, Y, and Z technologies, but much harder to assess their higher-level writing skills &mdash; their ability to create, synthesize, integrate, or distill large amount of complex information. You can ask for writing samples, but samples are hard to evaluate unless you know the product, context, and history of the documentation. So writing tends to be neglected in metrics for job ads, even though presumably this is the most salient skill that you're hiring for, Ellis says.

At any rate, having "writing skills" doesn't seem to resonate as much anymore because, presumably, everyone can write &mdash; or at least write well enough to get the job passably done. What's important, it seems, is technical acumen and subject matter familiarity, not stylistic flair. After all, would you rather hire Shakespeare to write your docs or the person who wrote the program? So you hire the candidate with an engineering background and address any style issues with an editorial pass &mdash; because it's easier to teach writing than technical skills, some say.

In a recent issue of *Communication Design Quarterly*, Jennifer Mallette and Megan Gehrke argue that, in the workplace, tech comm subject matter expertise doesn't seem to count as much as, say, engineering subject matter expertise. Mallette and Gehrke's article focuses on the experience of "Megan." Megan's training in Boise's Master of Arts in Technical Communication program led her to believe that her expertise in tech comm would be valued in the workplace in the same way that engineers are valued for their expertise. After all, in the program, students were treated like their expertise (in tech comm) mattered. They assumed that in the workplace, exchanges between tech writers and engineers would be made from a position of equality, where the tech writer's decisions and recommendations about content and communication would be valued and acted upon in the same way as engineers' decisions and recommendations.

They were led to believe that technical writers *are* specialists, but of another kind of knowledge. As a technical writer, you're a specialist in language simplification, clarity, information usability, publishing, and user analysis.

Unfortunately, Megan found that wasn't the case in the workplace. Instead, she was a second-class citizen. "Subject matter expertise" was a status not available for tech writers, who were basically secretaries or scribes in the organization. Anyone could challenge or dismiss the technical writer's decisions about content, as the product owner or engineer ultimately owned the content and carried the authority. Instead, Megan had to argue the rationale behind her decisions, often resorting to presenting similar approaches in competitor's documentation. The authors explain:

> In some instances, no matter how a technical communicator works to build up credibility and SME status, product owners and SMEs can quickly override a recommendation. Although frustrating, Megan recognizes that the most she can do in these instances is assert her reasons for revisions, reference any available data, and state that she isn’t aligned with the decision as a way to continue to assert her expertise.

This "power hierarchy," where "where communicators are viewed as support or secondary," is somewhat pervasive in the profession. It seems that very few engineers and product managers are willing to grant the holy status of SME to the technical writer.

Rather than taking more active, lead roles in content creation, Megan found that in the workplace, technical writers are more passive &mdash; "waiting" and "receiving" information and reviews from SMEs. They say, "... Technical communicators are still responding to SME needs rather than acting as a partner in leading communication." Megan had to argue for her own value in the organization. The authors point to other research that finds similar experiences in the workplace. For example,

> Kimball (2015) also comments that technical communicators are limited to roles as scribes or “a matter of writing down things other people say, rather than of being involved in more strategic decisions about product development.”

in [Combatting the "Make-It-Pretty" Philosophy](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/07/18/stereotypes-about-tech-writers-in-workplace), Emily January Petersen interviewed technical writers about their experience in the workplace and  highlighted their individual stories. Here Petersen explains the experience of one of the interviewees named Betty:

> Betty added that technical communicators should use the technical knowledge they learn over the years to prove value: “You get to become a subject matter expert in whatever you write about, and if you take that and run with it, pretty soon you’ve got this enormous bag of technical knowledge that you can reach in and pull out the right piece and throw it into the conversation as needed. You develop credibility quickly if you are able to make a relevant technical observation.” She used her knowledge from experience to prove value to colleagues. The expertise of practitioners may be unknown to colleagues. Technical communicators must make that visible. Practitioners are positioned to address this problem in organizations because their work is about making connections and building relationships.

Here the subject matter expertise focuses on technical knowledge, not tech comm knowledge. This assumption about what it means to have subject matter expertise reinforces what the workplace values. But regardless of what type of subject matter expertise you have, Petersen says you have to "make that visible."

In my recent blog post, [If writing is no longer a marketable skill, what is?](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/08/09/writing-no-longer-a-skill/), I noted (after comparing web metrics) that writing skills don't seem to sell in the job market, so you have to supplement writing skills with some kind of hybridization to make them seem valuable. I took a poll on my site to see which hybrid job titles were most common, and out of 277 respondents, the top roles were as follows:

* Technical writer/editor (14%)
* Technical writer/content strategist (7%)
* Technical writer/information architect (7%)
* Technical writer/project manager (7%)
* Technical writer/information designer (6%)
* Technical writer/content developer (7%)
* Technical writer/API docs specialist (5%)
* Technical writer/doc tools guru (5%)
* Technical writer/usability specialist (4%)
* Technical writer/UX copywriter (3%)
* Technical writer/video producer (3%)
* Technical writer/DITA specialist (3%)

<img src="images/hybridtechcommrole.png" />

Of course, these dual roles are self-defined only. In the HR books, one is usually still classified as a "technical writer," but that's not how we promote ourselves. Just being a "technical writer" isn't nearly sexy enough to sell yourself in the technology marketplace.

## Reducing technical writing to keyboarding

One of the early trends to carve the intellectual heart out of technical writing was the content strategy movement. When content strategy became a common term, it deflated the theoretical and analytical foundations of technical writing, reducing the act of writing to mere wordsmithing. If you chose to do define workflows around the creation, publication, and governance of content, that was no longer an activity that would fall under "technical writing."

The discussion about whether writing involves strategic and analytic thought has been going on in other disciplines as well, such as in academia. Writing is rarely allowed to be its own discipline but is rather a complementary skill for other knowledge-oriented fields such as Engineering. Robert Johnson, a professor of writing, counter-argues by noting that from the earliest days of the Greeks, true artists had to consider the end goals of their art. Johnson explains,

> … *techne* and the arts of making have two ends (*telos*). The initial end is the thing being produced, the product. Beyond the product, however, is the use (or uses) for the product. ([Craft Knowledge: Of Disciplinarity in Writing Studies](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27917868))

In other words, a writer (or artist or craftsperson) isn't merely a word technician &mdash; someone who understands grammar and style and nothing more. A writer considers the end goal of the content and develops strategies designed to achieve those ends. Achieving the end goal very commonly involves acquiring, analyzing, digesting, and articulating *technical knowledge and information*. Subject matter familiarity is a necessary component for achieving the ends of discourse.

And yet, that's not how people perceive writing anymore. Writing is merely wordsmithing of content. The development of the ideas and knowledge behind the content is ... another function.

## More complexity in technology is driving the valuation of technical knowledge

What exactly is driving the emphasis on technical knowledge over writing skills? If you consider an analogy from economics, technical knowledge is becoming more prized because it is becoming a scarce commodity. And it is becoming a scarce commodity because technology is getting more complex and specialized. It is the law of supply and demand at work in the enterprise, applied to knowledge. When very few people have knowledge of X, your possession of X knowledge can make you highly valued (assuming people care about X).

Because the technology landscape itself is becoming more complex and specialized, it is driving up the value of technical knowledge.

How do we know if technology is getting more complex? In [Implications of Tech Stack Complexity for Executives](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/implications-tech-stack-complexity-executives), the authors explain that one reason the technology landscape has shifted towards greater complexity is due to a transition away from single vendor systems. The authors explain:

> Not too many years ago, before social media, mobility, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud, and big data muddied the field, technology stacks (the different layers of technology required to implement an application) were simpler and often vendor-specific. A good example is the Microsoft stack: .NET languages for programming, IIS as a web and application server, and the SQL Server database.
>
> Today, technology stacks have exploded. We have platforms such as Microsoft Nano Server, Deis, Fastly, Apache Spark and Kubernetes. New tools pop up every week including Docker Toolbox, Gitrob, Polly, Prometheus and Sleepy Puppy. Programming languages and new frameworks such as Nancy, Axon, Frege, and Traveling Ruby are introduced. Advanced techniques such as the Data Lake, Gitflow, Flux and NoPSD mature. This list goes on and on.

They depict the change as follows:

{% include course_image.html url="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/implications-tech-stack-complexity-executives" size="" border="" filename="techstackcomplexity" ext_print="png" ext_web="png" alt="Image from Thoughtworks" caption="Image from <a href='https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/implications-tech-stack-complexity-executives'>" %}

For companies to develop world-class software, the authors explain, finding the IT talent to develop these sophisticated solutions can be a real challenge. The authors say that "not only has the breadth of skills increased, but the depth of skill required (advanced versus basic) has increased also." And given how quickly technologies are changing, you also need people who aren't just locked in the present but who will "quickly acquire" tomorrow's technologies as well.

In [*Overcomplicated: Technology at the Limits of Comprehension*](https://www.amazon.com/Overcomplicated-Technology-at-Limits-Comprehension/dp/0143131303), Samuel Arbesman also expands on the trend away from single solution systems to multiple system solutions. Arbesman talks about how we’ve built systems that very few people fully understand, and these systems are interacting with other systems (often through APIs) in ways no one can fully predict. Sometimes when these complex systems have bugs (such as with Toyota’s acceleration problem), we end up scrambling through millions of lines of code across many different systems, trying in vain to find the problem.

Again, what's the end result of this increased complexity? In software development contexts, technical knowledge is increasing in its value while generalist skills like writing are decreasing in value.

In a comical article called [How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f), Jose Aguinaga contrasts what it's like to learn JavaScript today versus a number of years ago. His format is an imagined conversation between a newbie and advanced frontend developer. Here's a quick excerpt:

> I need to create a page that displays the latest activity from the users, so I just need to get the data from the REST endpoint and display it in some sort of filterable table, and update it if anything changes in the server. I was thinking maybe using jQuery to fetch and display the data?
>
> -Oh my god no, no one uses jQuery anymore. You should try learning React, it’s 2016.
>
> Oh, OK. What’s React?
>
> -It’s a super cool library made by some guys at Facebook, it really brings control and performance to your application, by allowing you to handle any view changes very easily.
>
> That sounds neat. Can I use React to display data from the server?
>
> -Yeah, but first you need to add React and React DOM as a library in your webpage....

Aguinaga goes on to explain about 30 confusing JavaScript frameworks and technologies that frontend developers need to sort through when coding, including React, JSX, Babel, ES6, Browserify, WebPack, VueJS, RxJS, Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, SystemJS, Typescript, OCaml, Ramda, Fetch, Request, Bluebird, Axios, Flux, Flummox, Alt, Fluxible, Redux, SystemJS, and dozens more JS frameworks and tools.

Aguinaga's article illustrates how, for the past few decades (at least behind the scenes in the realm of development), technology has been getting more and more complex and specialized &mdash; more extensive, varied, complicated, and deep. The engineer who implements the frontend of a site has a very different skill set from the one working on the backend.

For contrast, think back to a time when we had "webmasters." The idea of a "webmaster" &mdash; a person who handles all aspects of a website &mdash; is an especially dated idea. Specialization has permeated all aspects of technology organizations. Today, you’re not just a "software developer." You’re a JavaScript developer for web apps, you’re an Oracle database specialist, you’re a release management configuration engineer, and so on.

We have these specialists because complexity has increased. An article in the _Harvard Business Review_ noted that we’ve even moved past specialization into "Hyperspecialization." The authors explain,

> Just as people in the early days of industrialization saw single jobs (such as a pin maker’s) transformed into many jobs (Adam Smith observed 18 separate steps in a pin factory), we will now see knowledge-worker jobs &mdash; salesperson, secretary, engineer &mdash; atomize into complex networks of people all over the world performing highly specialized tasks. ([The Big Idea: The Age of Hyperspecialization](https://hbr.org/2011/07/the-big-idea-the-age-of-hyperspecialization))

The author notes that with some encyclopedia articles, even different paragraphs _within the same_ article are sometimes written by different specialists. Each specialist-written paragraph fits together into a larger article.

Some might object that technology is getting simpler for users, which makes the job of technical writers easier because we write for users who are the recipients of these simpler UIs. The level of complexity depends on your audience, but generally technical writers are pulled towards scenarios of complexity rather than simplicity. You might be writing for internal engineers, engineers in other companies, or other professionals that aren't engineers or end-users but somewhere else along the technology spectrum.

And for sure, some user interfaces are getting simpler (thanks UX designers!), but the code behind them is also getting more complex. The classic example of this shift towards simple frontends and complex backends is Google’s homepage. On the surface, it looks pretty simple. But go to View > Source and copy the code on that page, and then paste it into Microsoft Word. It’s _73_ pages long!

{% include course_image.html url="https://google.com/" filename="googlehomepagescreenshot" ext_print="png" ext_web="png" alt="Google's home page looks simple on the surface, but the code fills 73 pages" caption="Google's home page looks simple on the surface, but the code fills 73 pages." %}

Explaining available search parameters might be easy, but explaining the SEO algorithm behind the search is surely complex. The level of difficulty depends on who you're writing for.

Consider another example: voice interaction. When I say to my Fire TV, "Alexa, show me the latest action movies," this natural language interface attempts to simplify the user experience. There’s no need to find the right menu, to type out my search using the remote controller’s direction pad, and so on. End-users can just use their natural language.

But behind the scenes, making this simple language interaction has an incredible amount of complexity and code. There are multiple systems interacting in harmony with each other &mdash; or sometimes clashing, which can result in Alexa misinterpreting your utterance and returning something unexpected.

Technology is like an iceberg &mdash; seemingly simple on the surface for end-users, but with massive amounts of code underneath.

## Trying in vain to keep up with the pace of technology

Looking at diagrams like those in the previous section strikes a bit of terror inside me because I realize how challenging it is to stay current in the evolving, deepening technology landscape. So often at work I find myself presented with some new topic to document (or even just edit) that I have very little knowledge of. It takes me by surprise, and I realize how endless the technology landscape is and how unaware I am of so many tools and languages, from code to concepts. Granted, Android app development for Fire TV (my current focus) is an extensive topic, but more often than not I'm constantly playing a catch-up game with what I need to know. It doesn't help that the number of engineering teams I support seems to be growing every year.

If there's one question that vexes me as a technical writer, it's this: In this era of increasing technological complexity and specialization, is there any room for generalists like me? Do we technical writers, who are typically generalists in the subjects we write about, need to become specialists, focusing in on a couple of domains in depth, so that we can write, edit, and publish more adeptly in those domains? Is specialization the only way to handle complexity?

Despite the need for this more specialized knowledge, I'm still responsible for many different aspects of content, from the publishing toolchain and output to web analytics, information architecture, metadata, content strategy, and more across so many different categories of technical products; as such, specialization is nearly impossible. At most, I can hope to possess a degree of technical acuity or aptitude that makes me mildly competent to collaborate with engineers and other specialists on the content.

I'm not alone in this feeling. In surveys I've done in the past, keeping up with the latest technology is one of the primary challenges for technical writers. About a decade ago (in 2007), I had a [virtual chat with a group of tech writers](https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/03/01/number-one-issue-for-technical-writers-today-keeping-pace-with-rapidly-evolving-technology/) to find out what their most pressing challenges were. Their answers (remember, this was 11 years ago in 2007) included the following:

> *   "For me, it's keeping up with the right technology and fighting to increase productivity without making our jobs horrid."
> *   "I have trouble keeping up with the rapid pace of innovation in the IT world and the many ways to deliver content."
> *   "Part of the problem about keeping pace with technology is that we often work under tight deadlines. ... at the end of the day, to learn new tools and technology, it's often on your own time."
> *   "I agree and I'm willing to learn about new tools and technology. The question is, where to start, what's the right thing to get into? What do I recommend that the company invest in?"
> *   "Another problem with keeping pace with technology is the sheer variety of languages, systems, tools, concepts, etc. There is so much to know. One can't know it all. But I think we have to be savvy enough to learn what we need to know at the moment we need it."
> *   "The most significant challenges and changes have been the budgets have been slashed for projects/training/user communication in general. No time/budget/interest in keeping me trained in my field. That is my biggest challenge right now. Years ago, I was regularly sent by FPC to conferences/seminars. Now it's a rare event."

Can you imagine how these same writers must feel now? How do you keep up? In a recent post, I polled writers to find out how much time they felt they *should devote* to learning technology each day to be successful in their role. Of the 40 responses, about 30% said 30 minutes, 30% said 1 hour, and 15% said 2 hrs.

But I also asked how much time they *actually devote* to learning technology each day. 27% said 0 minutes, 30% said 20 minutes, 19% said 30 minutes, and only 13% said 1 hour (see [Strategies for learning technology -- podcast recommendation and a poll](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/08/10/how-much-time-devoted-to-learning-tech-is-needed/)).

Given how much technical knowledge you need to be functionally able to write documentation in today's landscape, how can one possibly ramp up the right level of knowledge by just spending 30 minutes or less each day? I felt I would need 2 hours a day to feel comfortable writing in some of these domains, but as another writer noted, it's not always clear where to start. There is such diversity in what we document, it can be like moving from one long line to another long line in an amusement park &mdash; spending hours of learning just to be able to write one sentence that lasts 30 seconds.

In the end, who has 2 hours a day to carve out time for this learning, either at work or home? It's nearly impossible unless you incorporate it into your job itself. But when I tried that, I found that [my productivity plummeted](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/11/19/avoid-being-secretary-for-engineers/).

## Technical knowledge is essential to writing

Despite the difficulty in learning and keeping up with technology, technical knowledge is essential if you want to write documentation for engineers or other specialists. Without a comfortable understanding of the technical knowledge, your ability to write becomes crippled.

One approach to ramping up on this complexity might be to reduce your scope a bit and focus in on 1-2 projects in more immersive, in-depth ways than you could with 5-6 projects. However, it's not always possible to reduce your scope. What, then, can you do?

In some companies, when we escalated concerns about needing more resources so that we could immerse and engage more fully with teams, executives responded by explaining that the company couldn't afford to hire armies of tech writers, but that we had to "lean-in" on product teams to produce the documentation themselves. In other words, we would act more like editors and publishers, while the engineers did more of the content development.

There are all kinds of problems with having engineers write. I don't want to go into the problems too much here. (First is that engineers often don't want to write, or if they do, they put such little effort into writing that it becomes a nightmare to fix. And since many engineers aren't native English speakers in the first place, the content they write combined with the technology terms and lingo can become a nearly impenetrable jungle for the technical writer/editor to navigate. In some happy scenarios, engineers turn out to write quite well, though.)

However much I dislike the model where engineers develop content and technical writers add information usability, this just might be the norm in years to come. If the content is so specialized that only engineers can fully articulate it at the required level, then technical writers will play more supporting editorial roles, guiding engineers with content creation and making the information more readable/usable.

The degree to which engineers collaborate in the documentation process falls along a spectrum, for sure. But I don't see how we can accommodate increasing amounts of specialization and complexity in the technology landscape without also incorporating more engineers into the writing process. Also, recognizing that documentation is now a collaborative effort more than before helps me set certain expectations and workflows. It removes some of the pressure of feeling like I need to constantly acquire in-depth specialized knowledge to do my job.

{% include course_image.html filename="generalist_specialist_developers_writing" ext_print="svg" ext_web="svg" alt="More developers are assisting with documentation because the content is so technical, they're often the only ones who understand it at the level necessary" caption="More developers are assisting with documentation because the content is so technical, they're often the only ones who understand it at the level necessary" %}

I've found that engineers are actually good at writing certain kinds of docs, and poor at others. Engineers excel at writing reference documentation, especially when there are standards they're writing to (such as the OpenAPI specification). Engineers are also good at commenting on code samples, which is an area where technical writers often fall short. Engineers aren't nearly as good with conceptual documentation and tutorials, in part because they're too close to the material.

Note that playing more of an editorial/publisher role does not remove the technical writer's need for *adequate* technical knowledge. Unless you have some familiarity with the technology domain, you'd be limited only to stylistic edits. One must have a basic understanding of the technology domain to shape coherence, clarity, terminology, goals and information needs, etc.

In fact, when I've presented this dilemma between being a specialist or generalist to various groups, one common response is to settle on the middle ground of "technical acuity." Someone with technical acuity possesses a technical mindset. With this technical mindset, he or she might be inclined to look at system inputs and outputs, at algorithms that drive application logic, or more. Maybe he or she has a systematic patience for troubleshooting by comparing working code against broken code in a line-by-line fashion, or other troubleshooting insights.

In other words, the person with technical acuity might not know Python (perhaps what a hiring manager wants), but his or her in-depth knowledge of C# and, say, big data analysis might have prepared the person with the technical mindset needed to grok the Python info that's needed in a particular project. The skill you need is the ability to ramp up on the needed technical knowledge to the extent needed for the documentation tasks.

## Conclusion

So, summing it up. What trends are we seeing? One underlying trend is that technology seems to be getting more specialized and complex. This trend toward specialization is driving up the value of technical knowledge, making it more prized than writing skills. To handle the complexity, technical writers may find that they are playing increasingly collaborative roles with engineers to create the needed documentation. To drive up their value in organizations, technical writers should look for ways to collaborate more skillfully with engineers in creating content.
