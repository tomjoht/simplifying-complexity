At the end of each section, I include a list of questions, relevant to that principle, that can be used to interrogate a text. I include them here in a consolidated way for convenience:


{% include_relative macro-micro-questions.md %}
{% include_relative discoverability-through-metadata-questions.md %}
{% include_relative ensuring-information-harmony-in-the-larger-documentation-landscape-questions.md %}
{% include_relative reduction-layering-distillation-questions.md %}
{% include_relative reducing-complexity-by-shaping-into-schemas-esp-story-questions.md %}
{% include_relative reconstructing-the-absent-user-questions.md %}
{% include_relative reducing-the-complexity-of-language-questions.md %}
{% include_relative articulate-invisible-stories-that-influence-action-questions.md %}
