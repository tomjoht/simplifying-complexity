## Questions for reconstructing the absent user

* Who is the user? What do you know about the user? For example, what are their goals, what's their technical level, what are they building, how are they reading your information, what language do they speak fluently?
* What do metrics tell you about how users are interacting with this content?
* Are you capturing any feedback about this content based on your feedback mechanisms?
* What kind of support tickets have been filed against the topic?
* Can you reach out to a target group of users to gather more information about their experience with the topic?
