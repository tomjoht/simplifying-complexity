## Questions for reducing and distilling vast information down to its essence

Some questions you might ask of a text include the following:

* Is there a high-level summary at the top of the document?
* Is there a mini-table of contents in the document?
* Are the headings descriptive of the content, allowing users to consume it at a glance?
* Have you stripped away or hidden the non-essential information that users might consider extraneous to their core tasks?
