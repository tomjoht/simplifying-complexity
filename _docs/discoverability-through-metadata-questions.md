## Questions for making information discoverable as the user needs it

* How will users discover this information?
* Is the topic SEO friendly for keywords that users would target?
* Are there places in the UI (or in error messages, etc.) where we could link to the topic?
* Could this be a related topic in other areas where users might end up, such as on other topics (as they follow the information scent in the docs)?
* What metadata attributes should this information have (audience, location, operating system, device, language, etc.)? How can we map this metadata to the user to surface this content more naturally to the user's context?
