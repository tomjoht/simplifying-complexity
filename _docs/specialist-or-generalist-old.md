To write about complex topics, you need some knowledge of the topic. You might not have as much knowledge as a subject matter expert, who could be an engineer working in the code all day, but your knowledge has to go beyond the shallowness of a generalist. This is because content authoring of any kind involves the articulation of knowledge. Without knowledge and understanding of the subject (even if not thorough or at the level of an engineer), you can't develop content; you can only edit and publish content and work beside others who have that knowledge. That said, technical writers are responsible for too many aspects of content and technical categories to develop specialized knowledge in a subject domain that competes with an engineers' knowledge. At most, technical writers can develop technical aptitude and try to learn what they need to know for each product and documentation scenario, and also collaborate with engineers to fill in the gaps.

## Always playing catch-up

So often at work I find myself presented with some new topic to document (or even just edit) that I have very little knowledge of. It takes me by surprise, and I realize how endless the technology landscape is and how unaware I am of so many tools and languages, from code to concepts. Granted, Android app development for Fire TV (my current focus) is an extensive topic, but more often than not I'm constantly playing a catch-up game with what I need to know. It doesn't help that the number of engineering teams I support seems to be growing every year.

If there's one question that vexes me as a technical writer, it's this: In this era of increasing technological complexity and specialization, is there any room for generalists like me? Do we technical writers, who are typically generalists in the subjects we write about, need to become specialists, focusing in on a couple of domains in depth, so that we can write, edit, and publish more adeptly in those domains? Is specialization the only way to handle complexity?

In the past 20 years, technology seems to be getting more specialized and complex. The increased level of complexity requires technical writers to increase their own knowledge if they're going to contribute in these more complex domains. Even so, technical writers tend to be responsible for many different aspects of content, from the publishing toolchain and output to web analytics, information architecture, metadata, content strategy, and more across so many different categories of technical tools and products; as such, specialization is nearly impossible. At most, one can hope to possess a degree of technical acuity or aptitude that makes him or her mildly competent to collaborate with engineers and other specialists on the content.

Overall, to drive up our value in organizations, as technical writers we should not only increase own technical knowledge but also look for ways to collaborate more skillfully with engineers in creating content.

## Are jobs in tech comm becoming more technical?

Technical writing jobs have always focused on areas of complexity. Tech writing jobs for mainstream end-users are dwindling, while jobs for more technical audiences, often including developers or other engineering types, seem to be increasing.

In a recent episode of the Cherryleaf podcast, [40. The evolution of the technical communicator’s career](https://cherryleaf.podbean.com/e/the-evolution-of-technical-communication/), Ellis Pratt discusses an article called [Software technical writing is a dying career (but here’s what writers can do to stay in the software game)](https://softwaresaltmines.com/2015/06/16/software-technical-writing-dying/), by Jim Grey published in 2015.

Grey’s main argument is that "companies are leaning into good user-interface design and stepping away from online Help systems and printed/PDF documentation." Grey explains that he had lunch with a business owner who explained this transition, saying:

> Technical writing is dying off.... It’s all about clean, engaging UX now. I have talked to more than a hundred startup and small software companies as I’ve built my business. Almost none of them have technical writers, and almost all of them have UX designers.

Grey argues that UX design has displaced the need for tech comm in software companies. Instead of hiring a tech writer to provide explanations for confusing interfaces, companies hire UX designers to get the design intuitive from the start.

<figure><img src="images/generalist_specialist_design_not_docs.svg"/><figcaption>Grey says the trend, at least for end-user products, is to hire UX designers to create intuitive products that don't need documentation</figcaption></figure>

Sensing his irrelevance as a technical writer, Grey jumped off the documentation ship and into software testing instead.

Because of the usability skills that UX designers bring to interfaces (e.g., if the UX is good, you shouldn't need a thick manual to accompany your UI), there's less of a need for documentation roles around user interfaces. As a result, the tech comm work is shifting towards areas of complexity, where the need for documentation is strong.

Sure, many writers still perform some UX copywriting related to intuitive user interfaces. Many UX designers champion the need for master wordsmiths (often technical writers) to provide input on button labels, error messages, and other microcopy in the UI. And in many ways, the documentation is more integrated into the UI through expand/collapse sections, shelfs that users pull down, modals that appear when clicked, and so on.

But I think UX copywriting tends to be a less frequent task (unless your company is really pushing out a lot of GUI-based products). Most of my work still focuses on products for more technical audiences, often developers. At least this is where most of the jobs are in Silicon Valley, and it's where more challenging skillsets are needed.

## Looking at the data

It's easy to trade anecdotes about jobs increasing or decreasing in different contexts, but where is the evidence? Was Grey right or wrong about tech comm dying in UX contexts? Are tech comm jobs, in fact, diminishing? If you look at the latest [STC Salary Database](https://www.stc.org/salary-database/), based on Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, you can see that tech writing jobs have actually grown by about 3,620 jobs in 4 years:

<figure><a href="https://www.stc.org/salary-database/"><img src="https://idratherbewriting.com/images/techwriterjobsovertime.png"/></a><figcaption>Tech writing jobs have grown slightly since 2012, up by about 3,620 jobs.</figcaption></figure>

Overall, in 2016, there were about 50,000 technical writing jobs in the United States. The report notes that technical writing is "the only occupation [among professional writing disciplines] which has seen employment growth in each year since 2011, with an average annual employment increase of 1.9%."

Despite the mild growth, technical writing jobs aren't necessarily keeping pace with software development jobs. The BLS says the [job growth for software developers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/software-developers.htm) from 2016 to 2026 is projected at 24%, but for [technical writers](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/technical-writers.htm), the job growth is projected at just 11%. (Both growth rates are higher than the national average, which is 7%.)

To put these numbers into perspective, suppose 10 technical writers support 1,000 engineers. In 2026, **11** technical writers will support **1,240** engineers. If the rate stays the same for the next decade, in 2036, **12** technical writers will support **1,538** engineers.

So while technical writing jobs might not be diminishing, they are shrinking proportionally. But as far as measuring the impact of UX or other causes affecting the job growth, the BLS has little to say except this:

> Employment growth will be driven by the continuing expansion of scientific and technical products. An increase in Web-based product support should also increase demand for technical writers. Job opportunities, especially for applicants with technical skills, are expected to be good.

This last point &mdash; "especially for applicants with technical skills" &mdash; is something I'll return to later. When we analyze job postings, the desire for candidates with subject-matter familiarity has been a recurring theme.

## An "evolution" of roles, but evolving towards what?

What does Pratt make of Grey's blog post? In the podcast, Pratt looks generally at job trends and decides that no, technical writing jobs haven’t gone away. Pratt's company, Cherryleaf, is primarily a recruiting agency for technical writers, so the mere fact that he's still in business suggests that companies are still seeking technical writers.

But Pratt does make another point. He says:

> Is this true? Has the tech writing job disappeared since 2015? Clearly not, because there are still … [many] technical writers and authors. But I think there is a truth in saying that the role of the technical author is changing, and the requirements and the skills that they need are changing as well. And it may be that the job title changes and the way in which the role is perceived.  

In other words, he says the jobs haven’t disappeared, but the _roles, requirements, and skills have evolved_. In a [survey in a previous post](https://www.questionpro.com/t/PESakZc1sh), I asked readers to agree or disagree with this statement: "Technical writing jobs haven't diminished, but the profession is evolving." Of the 82 respondents, about 55% of readers agree and 37% strongly agree with this statement (for a total of 92% agreement).

But beyond the general role, requirements, and skills, exactly *what* is evolving in tech comm? Are we changing in positive ways to align with tomorrow's needs? More importantly, what kind of data supports this assertion about the evolution of the profession? We need to get much more specific here if our analysis of trends will be useful.

## Looking at job advertisements to extrapolate the evolution of tech comm

To get a better picture of the role, requirements, and skills in demand, let's turn to some research based on an analysis of job advertisements. In "The Evolution of Technical Communication: An Analysis of Industry Job Postings" (Nov 2015 *Technical Communication Journal*), Eva Brumberger and Claire Lauer say that by looking for patterns in job advertisements, you can see what employers are looking for and hence learn what skills and needs are trending in the industry. They write:

> Job advertisements, as a genre, have the specific purpose of hiring an employee for a company or organization, so they typically include consistent kinds of descriptive information that can serve as a barometer of industry trends when studied over years and even decades.

In other words, if you want to know real trends, look at what employers are writing in job descriptions for the candidates they want to hire. After analyzing about 1,000 job postings (which appeared during a 60-day period in late 2013), what did Brumberger and Lauer find? They found that the job ads painted a picture far more diverse than the BLS's simplistic description of the technical writer occupation. The authors noted the incredible variety of roles and deliverables that tech comm professionals are engaged in.

However, part of this diversity is a result of Brumberger and Lauer's broad focus on job technical communication titles and categories. Some of the job titles included "Social Media Manager," "Front End Developer," "Web Content Analyst," "UI Designer," "Grant writer," "Medical writer," and more. They excluded job ads that focused exclusively on a technical tool or framework with no rhetorical role in communication. They also divided the job postings into five main categories: Content Developer/Manager, Grant/Proposal Writer, Medical Writer, Social Media Writer, and Technical Writer/Editor. Given this wide tech comm net they cast, it comes as little surprise that they would find tech comm professionals engaged in such a variety of work.

Although this wide scope is probably appropriate for a tech comm program, my interests relate mostly to technical writing, so I'm going to narrow my focus on this "technical writer/editor" category in Brumberger and Lauer's study.

52% of Brumberger and Lauer's analyzed job ads fall within the technical writer/editor category. Within technical writer/editor jobs, 26% of the advertisements are for IT services/software, followed by 18% in professional and business services. The greatest job concentrations for technical writers/editors are on the east or west coast. About 85% of what technical writers/editors produce are user guides/tech docs, 13% web content, 13% video content or multimedia, and 19% reports.

The most sought-after professional competencies for technical writers/editors include written communication (75%), Editing (51%), Project planning/mgmt (49%), Visual communication (49%), Subject-matter familiarity (45%), Working with SMEs (41%), and Style guides/standards (40%). They note:

> Overall, written communication continues to dominate the technical communication landscape, but our data emphasize that several additional professional competencies are also essential, most notably project management, editing, visual communication, research, and, as Lanier (2009) noted, subject matter familiarity.

Commenting on overall trends across the job categories, the researchers observe the need to push content across multiple channels while adhering to brand, and the need to build relationships with customers through content.

Most interesting to my question, the authors deliberate about whether it's a good idea to specialize with more subject matter familiarity. They say this familiarity is particularly relevant in technical writer/editor job categories. Given the broad range of skills, roles, and deliverables within the umbrella of technical communication, the authors argue remaining a jack-of-all-trades generalist would give you a lot of mobility and versatility within the field, empowering you with capabilities in a lot of different roles and functions. However, they acknowledge that others see specialized knowledge as being more valuable. The authors explain the view from another research study:

> Baehr (2015) [who studied perceptions of 8 tech comm managers] noted that this [specialization] was a point on which managerial perceptions varied; some participants felt that a broad skillset would “permit technical communicators to be more agile, adaptable, and flexible in their roles and to add greater value to organizations,” while others believed that specialization was “inevitable” (p. 116). Baehr concluded that the best course of action would be to develop multiple specializations, which would “enable technical communicators to define their own roles, to a certain extent” (p. 116). Our data suggest that there are several points of overlap in products and competencies, which could allow some degree of movement among job categories &mdash; or multiple specializations &mdash; if one maintains a broad skillset and flexible outlook.

In other words, the authors acknowledge that remaining a generalist would give you more mobility within the technical communication profession (leading to more "movement among job categories"), but they recommend multiple specializations as well, especially where the specializations might strategically overlap into multiple roles.

Baehr's research differs from Brumberger and Lauer's in that he didn't analyze job ads but rather interviewed a small handful of experts that are part of STC's advisory council to gather his insights and perspectives. Nevertheless, his end goal is largely the same. He wants to pinpoint what skills that define the core identity in the tech comm profession. Baehr says that specializations related to "information design, knowledge management, and information architecture" tend to be most common, "while others such as
interface design, usability, and user experience design were considered important, but weighed differently in organizational contexts."

In this light, Baehr's idea of "specialization" refers more to ancillary skills (e.g., information architecture) rather than subject matter familiarity with, say, a particular programming knowledge or industry, such as networking or finance. Thus this discussion about specialization and subject matter familiarity might not be focused on the same assumptions.

Regardless of the difference in definitions, as whether technical writers should be specialists or generalists, Baehr argues that "breadth of specializations" define the core identity of technical communicators. He concludes that "successful technical communicators adapt to fit the mold of what is needed."

The feedback from the advisory council members on whether to specialize seems to be mixed. If you decide to pour all your efforts into, say, learning Python, you might be well-suited for roles documenting Python-related APIs and SDKs, but beyond that, your skills will likely run shallow. In other words, you would be really qualified for the 2 Python documentation jobs but not so qualified for the 30 other technical writing roles that have nothing to do with Python and more that require knowledge of information design, information architecture, localization, and more.

If we compare a similar job advertisement analysis done seven years earlier by Clinton Lanier ("Analysis of the Skills Called for by Technical Communication Employers in Recruitment Postings", published in February 2009 in *Technical Communication Journal*), can we see any trends with criteria for subject matter familiarity?

Lanier analyzed 327 job postings in 2006, limiting the scope to jobs with "technical writer" in the title and that required two years of experience or less only (which would thus be most suitable for graduating students to apply for). Regarding subject matter familiarity, Lanier found the following:

> ... 112 of the postings (34%) required or desired the potential writer to have experience writing about the specific subject matter that the current job involves. [For example], if the candidate was applying for a software documentation job in which they were going to be writing application programming interfaces (APIs) or online help, many of the positions required or desired that they have written such types of documents for the related types of subject matter.

In other words, employers have been seeking subject matter familiarity among job applicants in a consistent way at least since 2006. Even for job postings requiring just two years of experience or less (almost entry-level positions), 34% of employers want the candidate to have subject matter familiarity.

Lanier even supports the need for specialization with other research, explaining:

> This reflects the trend that technical communication is moving away from a “Jack of all trades” model, where technical writing is a very generalized concept, and toward a model that is more specialized and contextually defined. Giammona (2004) likewise found participants stating that new writers would benefit from experience within the industry they are going to write for, and Kim and Tolley (2004) related the story of a writer whose supervisor found the participant’s background in science more important than her knowledge of computing.

Given that Lanier restricts his data set to jobs requiring 2 years or less of experience, it's hard to compare the data set with Brumberger and Lauer's. However, 34% in 2006 and 45% in 2013 suggests a constant emphasis on subject matter familiarity. Deciding to specialize in a particular engineering domain wouldn't be considered a *new* trend, but its consistency for the past 15 years suggests that it's an ongoing requirement.

## Specialization for senior level only?

We seem to be going back and forth here with the discussion about whether to specialize or not. It could be that both views are right, but referring to different points in a career.

In a recent *Content Strategy* podcast episode focusing on information architecture and content strategy, Abby Covert, a seasoned IA professional, says that junior IA positions are more generalist while senior IA positions can be specialized. In response to the question, "What obstacles and opportunities are you seeing in a matured discipline like IA?" Covert responds:

> [For those wanting to enter IA,] there's a real industry pressure to generalize your practice as opposed to specialize your practice. There's a very large contingent of companies who are hiring or programs in existence that will push someone that has interest in IA towards becoming a UX generalist &mdash; where they're doing visual design, they're doing prototyping, they're doing research, they're doing content strategy, they're doing information architecture.

> All of those things are important for [...] a career in IA. But when you get into the hiring world, companies want people that are, for lack of a better word, the unicorns, people that can do all of that, and can do all of it really well at that mid-to-senior level.

> What I see more often than not is people saying, "I really want to be an IA, I just don't know how to make money *just* doing that." Companies just aren't hiring just that. So we have a real chasm. There's a bunch of senior people that have IA specific roles, but the role of junior information architect is something that our community really struggles with, whether or not it even exists.

> ... In terms of information architecture, one of the things you have to be really comfortable with is complexity, and to throw someone who has very little experience and only a theoretical knowledge of dealing with complexity at actual complexity, is a risk, and a lot of organizations are not willing to take that risk with hiring completely green juniors into those roles.

> So I'm really seeing a misbalance of information architecture as a specialty being only those that are in the mid or senior levels of their career. Which I think is challenging because it's kind of like "Hey kid, I know you really want to be in IA, wait 5-7 years as a generalist and maybe you can be." ([Ep. 10: Information Architecture, Content Strategy...](h))

In other words, when you're starting out in IA, you don't focus exclusively on IA but rather play a UX generalist role. Only after you've accrued 5-7 years of experience does your role gravitate more exclusively on IA tasks.

For tech comm, the same argument might be made. When you're new to the field, you work on a wide variety of documentation-related tasks that define the generalist's breadth of skills. You might work on UI copy, reports, documentation for new features, presentations, analytics, blog posts, edits of existing topics, SEO, doc site design, and more. But as you become more experienced, you might focus exclusively on revamping the doc publishing system, or in producing a lengthy e-learning system, or creating API documentation, etc. You could become even more specialized &mdash; migrating thousands of pages to DITA from unstructured FrameMaker, implementing Swagger UI custom skins, or documenting Java programming SDKs.

Overall, what do we make of this debate about whether to be a specialist or generalist? It seems that there's quite a lot of debate on both sides. But when I surveyed readers to provide agreement/disagreement to this question:

> Subject matter familiarity is a key requirement in a lot of the tech comm jobs I've looked at. It seems employers often want me to know X, Y, and Z technologies already from the start.

50% agreed, 24% strongly agreed, and 13% were undecided. I think it's safe to say that employers are looking for tech writers who have all the skills they need &mdash; specialized knowledge *and* writing skills that span across categories and rhetorical situations, and more.

##  The full-stack technical writer

Despite the advantages of possessing specialized knowledge, there is a cost. It takes a lot of time to accrue this knowledge, and that time cost means neglect in other areas. James Rhea, in response to my post on [Generalist versus Specialist](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/12/20/changing-roles-of-technical-writers/), also says that “adequate” technical knowledge is usually enough to get the job done, and acquiring deeper technical knowledge has somewhat diminishing returns, since it means other aspects of documentation will likely be neglected. Rhea writes:

> I wouldn’t aim for deep technical knowledge. I would aim for adequate technical knowledge, recognizing that what constitutes adequacy may vary by project, and that technical knowledge ought to grow over time due to immersion in the documentation and exposure to the technology and the industry.
>
> I speculate that the need for writers to have deep technical knowledge diminishes as Tech Comm teams grow in size and as other skills become more important than they are for smaller Tech Comm teams. I’m not claiming that deep technical knowledge is useless. I’m suggesting that (to frame it negatively) neglecting deep technical knowledge has less severe consequences than neglecting content curation, doc tool set, or workflow considerations. (Adding Value as a Technical Writer)

In other words, if you spend excessive amounts of time learning to code, at the expense of tending to other documentation tasks such as shaping information architecture, analyzing user metrics, overseeing translation workflows, developing user personas, ensuring clear navigation, and more, your doc’s technical content might improve a bit, but the overall doc site will go downhill.

Additionally, while engineers can fill in the deep technical knowledge needed, no one will provide the tech comm tasks in place of a tech writer. As evidence, just look at any corporate wiki. Corporate wikis are prime examples of what happens when engineers (or other non-tech writers) write and publish documentation. Some pages might be rich with technical detail, but the degree of ROT (redundant, outdated, trivial content) gets compounded, navigation suffers, clarity gets muddled, and almost no one can find anything.

Additionally, even in engineering realms, some generalist skills are welcome. There is a notion of a "full-stack developer," which is one who has the knowledge and skills to navigate all the technology layers in the stack. There is some debate about the level of knowledge a full-stack developer possesses, but according to Codeup,

> a full-stack developer is simply someone who is familiar with all layers in computer software development. These developers aren’t experts at everything; they simply have a functional knowledge and ability to take a concept and turn it into a finished product. Such gurus make building software much easier as they understand how everything works from top to bottom and can anticipate problems accordingly. In our opinion, this is the most realistic definition of a full-stack developer.

> Often times,  this class of developers stems from start-up environments, where a vast knowledge of all facets of web development is essential for a business’ survival.

> Clearly, it takes years of work experience in different languages, roles, and industries to reach this level of qualification. Because of this, full stack developers are few and far between, making those who exist very employable and in-demand. ("What is a Full-Stack Developer?")

This skillset category flips the tables on the hierarchy of specialists versus generalists. Here the generalist is in high-demand, especially in start-up environments where employees often wear multiple hats. The same could be said for a technical writer in a start-up environment. In such an environment, a technical writer might be fully responsible for the doc toolchain and publishing system (requiring skills in HTML, CSS, JS, and publishing workflows that might involve Git, continuous deployment, and verification scripts), support systems and forums, e-learning and video creation, blog posts and marketing content such as white papers, information architecture to establish taxonomies around terminology and flow, and more. This is the equivalent of the "full-stack" technical writer.

So the degree to which generalist skills are needed depends on the size of your company, and whether these other functions are covered by other specialists already.

## Technical knowledge valued more than writing skills

One of the surprising things Lanier found was that most job advertisements explicitly sought specialized skills more than they sought writing skills. Lanier explains:

> ... it was a bit surprising to see the low number of postings calling for these technical writing specific skills (17%). After reading the articles discussed above, my assumption was that the request for these skills would be present in a large majority of the postings, but this was not the case. Again there seems to be a trend by employers to want specialized skills, evident by the larger number of postings asking for familiarity with the specific types of documents they work with (24%).

In other words, the job advertisements had a surprisingly low number of requests for technical writing specific skills (just 17%); instead, they focused more on the need for specialized knowledge skills (24%).

Imagine for a moment that you're a hiring manager. You have two candidates for a tech writing position: a former engineer who has a strong technical background but little writing experience, and an experienced writer who has a veteran track record and extensive portfolio but is new to the technology domain for the project. Who do you hire?

When I've been in situations like this, I've seen hiring managers (especially those from engineering backgrounds) choose the one with stronger technical skills and weaker writing skills. As long as the writing isn't red-flag poor, hiring managers are willing to overlook more advanced writing skills.

In a recent post in the technical writing forum on Reddit, a user commented:

> I work in engineering documentation, so I would always choose a candidate that has solid domain expertise even if they only have adequate writing skills. It's easier to train the writing skills than teach the domain expertise. ("How much weight does a certificate in technical writing carry?")

This sentiment is fairly common, especially among engineers.

This experience (and Lanier's research) points to a larger trend toward the devaluation of writing. Having "writing skills" doesn't seem to resonate much anymore because, presumably, everyone can write &mdash; or at least write well enough to get the job passably done. What's important, it seems, is technical acumen and subject matter familiarity, not stylistic flair. So you hire the candidate with an engineering background and address any style issues with an editorial pass &mdash; because it's easier to teach writing than technical skills, some say.

In a recent issue of *Communication Design Quarterly*, Jennifer Mallette and Megan Gehrke argue that subject matter expertise about tech comm doesn't count as much as subject matter expertise about more technical topics such as engineering. The article focuses on the experience of "Megan." Megan's training in Boise's Master of Arts in Technical Communication program led her to believe that her expertise in tech comm would be valued in the workplace in the same way that engineers are valued for their expertise. After all, in the program, students were led to believe their expertise in tech comm mattered. They assumed that in the workplace, exchanges between tech writers and engineers would be made from a position of equality, where the tech writer's decisions and recommendations about content and communication would be valued and acted upon in the same way as engineers' decisions and recommendations.

Unfortunately, Megan found that wasn't the case in the workplace. Instead, she was a second-class citizen. "Subject matter expertise" was a status not available for tech writers, who were basically secretaries or scribes in the organization. Anyone could challenge or dismiss the technical writer's decisions about content, as the product owner or engineer ultimately owned the content and carried the authority. Instead, Megan had to argue the rationale behind her decisions, often resorting to presenting similar approaches in competitor's documentation.

The authors explain:

> In some instances, no matter how a technical communicator works to build up credibility and SME status, product owners and SMEs can quickly override a recommendation. Although frustrating, Megan recognizes that the most she can do in these instances is assert her reasons for revisions, reference any available data, and state that she isn’t aligned with the decision as a way to continue to assert her expertise.

This "power hierarchy," where "where communicators are viewed as support or secondary," is somewhat pervasive in the profession. It seems that very few engineers and PMs are willing to grant the holy status of SME to the technical writer.

Rather than taking more active, lead roles in content creation, Megan found that in the workplace, technical writers are more passive &mdash; "waiting" and "receiving" information and reviews from SMEs. "... Technical communicators are still responding to SME needs rather than acting as a partner in leading communication." She had to argue for her own value in the organization. The authors point to other research that finds similar experiences in the workplace. For example,

> Kimball (2015) also comments that technical communicators are limited to roles as scribes or “a matter of writing down things other people say, rather than of being involved in more strategic decisions about product development.”

Emily January Petersen  [Combatting the "Make-It-Pretty" Philosophy](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/07/18/stereotypes-about-tech-writers-in-workplace). Petersen interviewed technical writers about their experience in the workplace and then highlighted their individual stories. Here Petersen explains the experience of one of the interviewees, Betty:

> Betty added that technical communicators should use the technical knowledge they learn over the years to prove value: “You get to become a subject matter expert in whatever you write about, and if you take that and run with it, pretty soon you’ve got this enormous bag of technical knowledge that you can reach in and pull out the right piece and throw it into the conversation as needed. You develop credibility quickly if you are able to make a relevant technical observation.” She used her knowledge from experience to prove value to colleagues. The expertise of practitioners may be unknown to colleagues. Technical communicators must make that visible. Practitioners are positioned to address this problem in organizations because their work is about making connections and building relationships.

Here the subject matter expertise focuses on technical knowledge, not tech comm knowledge. But regardless of what type of subject matter expertise you have, Petersen says you have to "make that visible."

Perhaps the solution is therefore to articulate the many rhetorical decisions and thought process and other variables that factor into the decisions about content.

Another approach would be to bring information about the user experience to the forefront to demonstrate the complexities of the docs, and how simply writing the content doesn't lead to success with users. I think many engineers might simply assume that all users will understand what they write. By presenting information about user analytics and feedback, perhaps others will have a better understanding of the difficult of the documentation task.

Ellis Pratt explained that technical skills are much easier than writing skills to quantify. It's easy to check boxes if a candidate knows X, Y, and Z technologies, but much harder to assess their higher-level writing skills &mdash; their ability to create, synthesize, integrate, or distill large amount of complex information. You can ask for writing samples, but samples are hard to evaluate unless you know the product, context, and history of the documentation. So writing tends to be neglected in metrics for job ads, even though presumably this is the most salient skill that you're hiring for.

In my recent blog post, [If writing is no longer a marketable skill, what is?](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/08/09/writing-no-longer-a-skill/), I noted (after comparing web metrics) that writing skills don't seem to sell in the job market, so you have to supplement writing skills with some kind of hybridization to make them seem valuable. I took a poll on my site to see which hybrid job titles were most common, and out of 277 respondents, the top roles were as follows:

* Technical writer/editor (14%)
* Technical writer/content strategist (7%)
* Technical writer/information architect (7%)
* Technical writer/project manager (7%)
* Technical writer/information designer (6%)
* Technical writer/content developer (7%)
* Technical writer/API docs specialist (5%)
* Technical writer/doc tools guru (5%)
* Technical writer/usability specialist (4%)
* Technical writer/UX copywriter (3%)
* Technical writer/video producer (3%)
* Technical writer/DITA specialist (3%)

Of course, these dual roles are self-defined only. In the HR books, one is usually still classified as a "technical writer," but that's not how we promote ourselves.

One of the early trends to carve the intellectual heart out of technical writing was the content strategy movement. When content strategy became a common term, it deflated the theoretical and analytical foundations of technical writing, reducing the act of writing to mere wordsmithing.

The discussion about whether writing involves strategic and analytic thought has been going on in other disciplines as well, such as in academia. Writing is rarely allowed to be its own discipline but is rather a complementary skill for other knowledge-oriented fields such as Engineering. Robert Johnson, a professor of writing, counter-argues by noting that from the earliest days of the Greeks, the true artist had to consider the end goals of their art. Johnson explains,

> … *techne* and the arts of making have two ends (*telos*). The initial end is the thing being produced, the product. Beyond the product, however, is the use (or uses) for the product. ([Craft Knowledge: Of Disciplinarity in Writing Studies](https://www.jstor.org/stable/27917868))

In other words, a writer (or artist or craftsperson) isn't merely a word technician &mdash; someone who understands grammar and style and nothing more. A writer considers the end goal of the content and develops strategies designed to achieve those ends. Achieving the end goal very commonly involves acquiring, analyzing, digesting, and articulating *technical knowledge and information*. Subject matter familiarity is a necessary component for achieving the ends of discourse.

And yet, that's not how people perceive writing anymore. Writing is merely wordsmithing of content. The development of the ideas and knowledge behind the content is ... another function.

## More complexity in technology is driving the valuation of technical knowledge

What exactly is driving the emphasis on technical knowledge over writing skills? If you consider an analogy from economics, technical knowledge is becoming more prized because it is becoming a scarce commodity. And it is becoming a scarce commodity because technology is getting more complex and specialized. It is the law of supply and demand at work in the enterprise, applied to knowledge. When very few people have knowledge of X, your possession of X knowledge can make you highly valued (assuming people care about X).

Some will object that technical writers *are* specialists, but of another kind of knowledge. As a technical writer, you're a specialist in language simplification, clarity, information usability, publishing, and user analysis. But is this type of knowledge *special* enough? Is it valued enough in the enterprise? Perhaps not. People seem to get by with simple tools like wikis and Microsoft Word, but they can't get by without the raw technical content.

Because the technology landscape itself is becoming more complex and specialized, it is driving up the value of technical knowledge.

How do we know if technology is getting more complex? In [Implications of Tech Stack Complexity for Executives](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/implications-tech-stack-complexity-executives), the authors explain that one reason the technology landscape has shifted towards greater complexity is due to a transition away from single vendor systems. The authors explain:

> Not too many years ago, before social media, mobility, the Internet of Things (IoT), cloud, and big data muddied the field, technology stacks (the different layers of technology required to implement an application) were simpler and often vendor-specific. A good example is the Microsoft stack: .NET languages for programming, IIS as a web and application server, and the SQL Server database.
>
> Today, technology stacks have exploded. We have platforms such as Microsoft Nano Server, Deis, Fastly, Apache Spark and Kubernetes. New tools pop up every week including Docker Toolbox, Gitrob, Polly, Prometheus and Sleepy Puppy. Programming languages and new frameworks such as Nancy, Axon, Frege, and Traveling Ruby are introduced. Advanced techniques such as the Data Lake, Gitflow, Flux and NoPSD mature. This list goes on and on.

They depict the change as follows:

<figure><a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/implications-tech-stack-complexity-executives"><img src="images/techstackcomplexity.png" /></a><figcaption>Image from <a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/implications-tech-stack-complexity-executives">Thoughtworks</a></figcaption></figure>

For companies to develop world-class software, the authors explain, finding the IT talent to develop these sophisticated solutions can be a real challenge. The authors say that "not only has the breadth of skills increased, but the depth of skill required (advanced versus basic) has increased also." And given how quickly technologies are changing, you also need people who aren't just locked in the present but who will "quickly acquire" tomorrow's technologies as well.

In [*Overcomplicated: Technology at the Limits of Comprehension*](https://www.amazon.com/Overcomplicated-Technology-at-Limits-Comprehension/dp/0143131303), Samuel Arbesman also expands on the trend away from single solution systems to multiple system solutions. Arbesman talks about how we’ve built systems that very few people fully understand, and these systems are interacting with other systems (often through APIs) in ways no one can fully predict. Sometimes when these complex systems have bugs (such as with Toyota’s acceleration problem), we end up scrambling through millions of lines of code across many different systems, trying in vain to find the problem.

Again, what's the end result of this increased complexity? In software development contexts, technical knowledge is increasing in its value while generalist skills like writing are decreasing in value.

In a comical article called [How it feels to learn JavaScript in 2016](https://hackernoon.com/how-it-feels-to-learn-javascript-in-2016-d3a717dd577f), Jose Aguinaga contrasts what it's like to learn JavaScript today versus a number of years ago. His format is an imagined conversation between a newbie and advanced frontend developer. Here's a quick excerpt:

> I need to create a page that displays the latest activity from the users, so I just need to get the data from the REST endpoint and display it in some sort of filterable table, and update it if anything changes in the server. I was thinking maybe using jQuery to fetch and display the data?
>
> -Oh my god no, no one uses jQuery anymore. You should try learning React, it’s 2016.
>
> Oh, OK. What’s React?
>
> -It’s a super cool library made by some guys at Facebook, it really brings control and performance to your application, by allowing you to handle any view changes very easily.
>
> That sounds neat. Can I use React to display data from the server?
>
> -Yeah, but first you need to add React and React DOM as a library in your webpage....

Aguinaga goes on to explain about 30 confusing JavaScript frameworks and technologies that frontend developers need to sort through when coding, including React, JSX, Babel, ES6, Browserify, WebPack, VueJS, RxJS, Grunt, Gulp, Broccoli, SystemJS, Typescript, OCaml, Ramda, Fetch, Request, Bluebird, Axios, Flux, Flummox, Alt, Fluxible, Redux, SystemJS, and dozens more JS frameworks and tools.

Aguinaga's article illustrates how, for the past few decades (at least behind the scenes in the realm of development), technology has been getting more and more complex and specialized &mdash; more extensive, varied, complicated, and deep. The engineer who implements the frontend of a site has a very different skill set from the one working on the backend.

For contrast, think back to a time when we had "webmasters." The idea of a "webmaster" &mdash; a person who handles all aspects of a website &mdash; is an especially dated idea. Specialization has permeated all aspects of technology organizations. Today, you’re not just a "software developer." You’re a JavaScript developer for web apps, you’re an Oracle database specialist, you’re a release management configuration engineer, and so on.

We have these specialists because complexity has increased. An article in the _Harvard Business Review_ noted that we’ve even moved past specialization into "Hyperspecialization." The authors explain,

> Just as people in the early days of industrialization saw single jobs (such as a pin maker’s) transformed into many jobs (Adam Smith observed 18 separate steps in a pin factory), we will now see knowledge-worker jobs &mdash; salesperson, secretary, engineer &mdash; atomize into complex networks of people all over the world performing highly specialized tasks. ([The Big Idea: The Age of Hyperspecialization](https://hbr.org/2011/07/the-big-idea-the-age-of-hyperspecialization))

The author notes that with some encyclopedia articles, even different paragraphs _within the same_ article are sometimes written by different specialists. Each specialist-written paragraph fits together into a larger article.

Some might object that technology is getting simpler for users, which makes the job of technical writers easier because we write for users who are the recipients of these simpler UIs.

The level of complexity depends on your audience, but generally technical writers are pulled towards scenarios of complexity rather than simplicity. You might be writing for internal engineers, engineers in other companies, or other professionals that aren't engineers or end-users but somewhere else along the technology spectrum.

And for sure, some user interfaces are getting simpler (thanks UX designers!), but the code behind them is also getting more complex. The classic example of this shift towards simple frontends and complex backends is Google’s homepage. On the surface, it looks pretty simple. But go to View > Source and copy the code on that page, and then paste it into Microsoft Word. It’s _73_ pages long!

<figure><a href="https://google.com/"><img src="images/googlehomepagescreenshot.png"/></a><figcaption>Google's home page looks simple on the surface, but the code fills 73 pages </figcaption></figure>

Explaining available search parameters might be easy, but explaining the SEO algorithm behind the search is surely complex. The level of difficulty depends on who you're writing for.

Consider another example: voice interaction. When I say to my Fire TV, "Alexa, show me the latest action movies," this natural language interface attempts to simplify the user experience. There’s no need to find the right menu, to type out my search using the remote controller’s direction pad, and so on. End-users can just use their natural language.

But behind the scenes, making this simple language interaction has an incredible amount of complexity and code. There are multiple systems interacting in harmony with each other &mdash; or sometimes clashing, which can result in Alexa misinterpreting your utterance and returning something unexpected.

Technology is like an iceberg &mdash; seemingly simple on the surface for end-users, but with massive amounts of code underneath.

<figure><img src="images/generalist_specialist_iceberg.svg" /><figcaption>Technology is often made simple on the surface for end users but is complex below the surface, dependent on a lot of advanced systems interacting with each other.</figcaption></figure>

## Trying in vain to keep up with the pace of technology

Looking at diagrams like those in the previous section strikes a bit of terror inside me because I realize how challenging it is to stay current in the evolving, deepening technology landscape. If you blink, you miss a new technology, and before you know it, your lack of understanding (what's "blockchain" again, or "containers"?) has dated you.

In surveys I've done in the past, keeping up with the latest technology is one of the primary challenges for technical writers. About a decade ago (in 2007), I had a [virtual chat with a group of tech writers](https://idratherbewriting.com/2007/03/01/number-one-issue-for-technical-writers-today-keeping-pace-with-rapidly-evolving-technology/) to find out what their most pressing challenges were. Their answers (remember, this was 11 years ago in 2007) included the following:

*   "For me, it's keeping up with the right technology and fighting to increase productivity without making our jobs horrid."
*   "I have trouble keeping up with the rapid pace of innovation in the IT world and the many ways to deliver content."
*   "Part of the problem about keeping pace with technology is that we often work under tight deadlines. ... at the end of the day, to learn new tools and technology, it's often on your own time."
*   "I agree and I'm willing to learn about new tools and technology. The question is, where to start, what's the right thing to get into? What do I recommend that the company invest in?"
*   "Another problem with keeping pace with technology is the sheer variety of languages, systems, tools, concepts, etc. There is so much to know. One can't know it all. But I think we have to be savvy enough to learn what we need to know at the moment we need it."
*   "The most significant challenges and changes have been the budgets have been slashed for projects/training/user communication in general. No time/budget/interest in keeping me trained in my field. That is my biggest challenge right now. Years ago, I was regularly sent by FPC to conferences/seminars. Now it's a rare event."

Can you imagine how these same writers must feel now? How do you keep up? In a recent post, I polled writers to find out how much time they felt they *should devote* to learning technology each day to be successful in their role. Of the 40 responses, about 30% said 30 minutes, 30% said 1 hour, and 15% said 2 hrs.

But I also asked how much time they *actually devote* to learning technology each day. 27% said 0 minutes, 30% said 20 minutes, 19% said 30 minutes, and only 13% said 1 hour (see [Strategies for learning technology -- podcast recommendation and a poll](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/08/10/how-much-time-devoted-to-learning-tech-is-needed/)).

Given how much technical knowledge you need to be functionally able to write documentation in today's landscape, how can one possibly ramp up the right level of knowledge by just spending 30 minutes or less each day? I felt I would need 2 hours a day to feel comfortable writing in some of these domains, but as another writer noted, it's not always clear where to start. There is such diversity in what we document, it can be like moving from one long line to another long line in an amusement park &mdash; spending hours of learning just to be able to write one sentence that lasts 30 seconds.

In the end, who has 2 hours a day to carve out time for this learning, either at work or home? It's nearly impossible unless you incorporate it into your job itself.

## Technical knowledge is essential to writing

Despite the difficulty in learning and keeping up with technology, technical knowledge is essential if you want to write documentation for engineers or other specialists. Without a comfortable understanding of the technical knowledge, your ability to write becomes crippled.

Because of this need for strong technical knowledge, [James Neiman](http://drjamesneiman.com/), an experienced API technical writer, says that tech writers need engineering backgrounds, such as a computer science degree or previous experience as an engineer to excel in API documentation roles. Neiman says tech writers often need to look over a developer's shoulder, watching the developer code or listening to an engineer's brief 15-minute explanation, and then return to their desks to create the documentation. He says you might need to take the code examples in Java and produce equivalent samples in another language, such as C++, all on your own.

Take a look at this video of Neiman and [Andrew Davis](http://www.synergistech.com/) (a recruiter for API tech writers in the Bay area) presenting on [Finding the right API Technical Writer](https://youtu.be/lmNHBg20ql0?t=1314) at an API conference in London. Their presentation format includes a Q&A exchange between the two. Scrub to around the 22-minute mark for the relevant part:

{% if site.format == "web" %}
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmNHBg20ql0?t=1314" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>
{% endif %}

Here's a transcript of the exchange:

> **Andrew**: Can a tech writer without a development background write great API documentation?
>
> **James**: Absolutely not. There is no way that a busy engineering team has time to train a person without a computer science degree. That's just the reality of it. Engineers at best can speak to you in some version of English, which may or may not be their native language. They don't have a lot of time, and they expect you to finish their thoughts for them. That means that you need to be able to sit next to them and look at how they're coding, and then be able to replicate that and extend it and even create examples.
>
> They may say, "Here's an example. You can extend it, add on these other APIs, work out this use case for us. We haven't had time to finish this." They can say, "Well, let me show you how this works in Objective C; we also support this on Java. Can you create something similar on Java?"
>
> If you don't have that kind of development background, it's unrealistic that you could expect to train, for example, somebody with a master's degree in English (and who is a very intelligent person but otherwise not technical) to do such a thing.

The focus here is on API documentation for developers, but I think a similar case could be made for other specialized engineering domains, from airplane maintenance procedures to pharmaceutical testing algorithms.

One approach to ramping up on this complexity might be to reduce your scope a bit and focus in on 1-2 projects in more immersive, in-depth ways than you could with 5-6 projects. However, as I noted earlier, it appears that the ratio of technical writers to developers is getting wider.

Another approach might be to spend more time in online courses and textbooks at work. This would reduce your productivity in the short-term, but it might increase your productivity in the long-term. But even if I were to start a steady course of C# learning, I doubt I'd be able to convert Java code samples to C# without engineering involvement.

Some push back on Neiman's standards for technical knowledge. [James Rhea says](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/12/20/changing-roles-of-technical-writers/) says that "adequate" technical knowledge is usually enough to get the job done, and acquiring deeper technical knowledge has somewhat diminishing returns, since it means other aspects of documentation will likely be neglected. Rhea explains:

> I wouldn't aim for deep technical knowledge. I would aim for adequate technical knowledge, recognizing that what constitutes adequacy may vary by project, and that technical knowledge ought to grow over time due to immersion in the documentation and exposure to the technology and the industry.
>
> I speculate that the need for writers to have deep technical knowledge diminishes as Tech Comm teams grow in size and as other skills become more important than they are for smaller Tech Comm teams. I'm not claiming that deep technical knowledge is useless. I'm suggesting that (to frame it negatively) neglecting deep technical knowledge has less severe consequences than neglecting content curation, doc tool set, or workflow considerations. ([Adding Value as a Technical Writer](https://withintheordinary.wordpress.com/2016/12/21/adding-value-as-a-technical-writer/))

In other words, if you spend excessive amounts of time learning to code, at the expense of tending to other documentation tasks such as shaping information architecture, analyzing user metrics, tending to localization workflows, developing user personas, ensuring clear navigation, and more, your doc's technical content might improve a bit, but the overall doc site will go downhill (just look at any internal company wiki as an example). Also, at some point, your knowledge will start to overlap the engineer's knowledge, so you'll end up with redundant capabilities.

At any rate, there is surely a good balance to be achieved between "technical" and "writing." While you don't need a specialist's understanding of a subject matter, some familiarity is necessary, if only to understand the right terms and foundational concepts.

## Embracing a more collaborative role in authoring specialized content

In some companies, when we escalated concerns about needing more resources so that we could immerse and engage more fully with teams, executives responded by explaining that the company couldn't afford to hire armies of tech writers, but that we had to "lean-in" on product teams to produce the documentation themselves. In other words, we would act more like editors and publishers, while the engineers did more of the content development.

There are all kinds of problems with having engineers write. I don't want to go into the problems too much here. (First is that engineers often don't want to write, or if they do, they put such little effort into writing that it becomes a nightmare to fix. And since many engineers aren't native English speakers in the first place, the content they write combined with the technology terms and lingo can become a nearly impenetrable jungle for the technical writer/editor to navigate. In some happy scenarios, engineers turn out to write quite well, though.)

However much I dislike the model where engineers develop content and technical writers add information usability, this just might be the norm in years to come. If the content is so specialized that only engineers can fully articulate it at the required level, then technical writers will play more supporting editorial roles, guiding engineers with content creation and making the information more readable/usable.

The degree to which engineers collaborate in the documentation process falls along a spectrum, for sure. But I don't see how we can accommodate increasing amounts of specialization and complexity in the technology landscape without also incorporating more engineers into the writing process.

<figure><img src="images/generalist_specialist_developers_writing.svg" /><figcaption>More developers are assisting with documentation because the content is so technical, they're often the only ones who understand it at the level necessary.</figcaption></figure>

I've found that engineers are actually good at writing certain kinds of docs, and poor at others. Engineers excel at writing reference documentation, especially when there are standards they're writing to (such as the OpenAPI specification). Engineers are also good at commenting on code samples, which is an area where technical writers often fall short. Engineers aren't nearly as good with conceptual documentation and tutorials, in part because they're too close to the material.

Note that playing more of an editorial/publisher role does not remove the technical writer's need for *adequate* technical knowledge. Unless you have some familiarity with the technology domain, you'd be limited only to stylistic edits. One must have a basic understanding of the technology domain to shape coherence, clarity, terminology, goals and information needs, etc.

However, recognizing that documentation is now a collaborative effort more than before  helps me set certain expectations and workflows. It removes some of the pressure of feeling like I need to constantly acquire in-depth specialized knowledge to do my job. Playing an editorial role also helps me focus on the information usability aspects of content. When you're elbow-deep *writing* content, you might run out of time/energy to address some of these other often overlooked aspects of information usability. Some of these information usability elements might include the following:

* Workflow and process maps across the content
* Visual diagrams and other multimedia to assist with key concepts
* Glossaries and alignment with industry standard terminology
* Information harmony for the topic across the entire dev portal
* Distillation of information into high-level summaries and quick reference guides
* Conducting surveys and feedback about the user experience
* Alignment of the product story with the user story

(It's kind of like cooking &mdash; when someone spends hours cooking dinner, they don't have the energy to also clear the table and wash the dishes. *Cookers aren't cleaners*, as they say.)

Finally, it's worth noting that because more engineers are contributing to documentation, there has also been a significant shift in authoring and publishing tools and processes. Much of the tech comm industry (particularly in developer documentation domains) has shifted from XML to Markdown and [docs-as-code tools](https://idratherbewriting.com/learnapidoc/pubapis_docs_as_code.html) because most [developers find XML too cumbersome and tedious](https://idratherbewriting.com/2014/09/30/why-developers-will-never-adopt-dita/), and Markdown so easy.

For example, Microsoft's developer docs were previously in XML, but they have since switched to a docs-as-code model. Check out [Open Authoring -- Collaboration Across Disciplines](https://idratherbewriting.com/2016/11/15/recording-of-open-authoring-collaboration-ralph-squillace/), by Ralph Squillace, for details. Microsoft is one of many companies making this switch. Google made huge strides in their internal documentation when they adopted an engineering approach of including Markdown files directly in repositories (see [Documentation, Disrupted: How two technical writers changed Google engineering culture](https://www.youtube.com/embed/EnB8GtPuauw) for more details). I also recently learned that [Citrix's developer docs](https://developer-docs.citrix.com/) just switched from an XML model to a docs-as-code model.

## Conclusion

So, summing it up. What trends are we seeing? One underlying trend is that technology seems to be getting more specialized and complex. This trend toward specialization is driving up the value of technical knowledge, making it more prized than writing skills. To handle the complexity, technical writers may find that they are playing increasingly collaborative roles with engineers to create the needed documentation. To drive up their value in organizations, technical writers should look for ways to collaborate more skillfully with engineers in creating content.

## Slides

For slides related to this topic, see [https://idratherbewriting.com/trends-collaboration-with-engineers/](https://idratherbewriting.com/trends-collaboration-with-engineers/).

## The unresolved debate between being a specialist or generalist

After I gave a [recent presentation on trends](https://idratherbewriting.com/2018/10/09/tech-comm-trends-more-collaboration-with-engineers/), some of the attendees felt I left the dilemma between being a specialist or a generalist unresolved. Some said, "So, should I be a specialist or a generalist, and if I specialize, what should I focus on?"

Others were incensed that I wasn't considering language expertise to count as specialized knowledge. I knew this was a controversial subject, and I would no doubt anger people off because to suggest that their writing expertise doesn't count as specialized knowledge in the same light as engineering specializations.

So there are a few loose ends that I'd like to resolve in this trends presentation before I give it again. Overall, in the Q&A after my session, attendees seemed to come to the conclusion that *technical acuity* was more important than specialized knowledge, and that it was better than being a generalist as well. In hindsight, my portrayal of the dilemma between being a specialist or generalist was an either/or fallacy. A third option &mdash; "technical acuity" &mdash; wasn't something I weighed and considered.

## What is technical acuity?

What do we mean by "technical acuity"? Someone with specialized knowledge might know Python in and out, but someone with technical acuity possesses a technical mindset. With this technical mindset, he or she might be inclined to look at system inputs and outputs, at algorithms that drive application logic, or more. Maybe he or she has a systematic patience for troubleshooting by comparing working code against broken code in a line-by-line fashion, or other troubleshooting insights.

In other words, the person with technical acuity might not know Python (perhaps what a hiring manager wants), but his or her in-depth knowledge of C# and, say, big data analysis might have prepared the person with the technical mindset needed to grok the Python info that's needed in a particular project.

## Why technical acuity over specialized knowledge?

Why might technical acuity be more valuable than specialized knowledge? Well, specialized knowledge in a particular subject domain is often difficult to find in candidates. For example, suppose you really want a tech writer who knows Android. Well, try as you might, there are so many different knowledge domains out there, the chances that the technical expertise in your candidate would align perfectly with your needs is pretty unlikely. This is especially true for technical writers, who often have a variety of projects involving different technical specializations.

For an example of the needed variety, look at this explosion of technologies between 2005 and 2016 as [depicted by Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/implications-tech-stack-complexity-executives):

<a href="https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/implications-tech-stack-complexity-executives"><img src="images/techstackcomplexity.png" /></a>

In the transition from single vendor technology stacks (e.g., Microsoft) to multi-vendor stacks, it's impractical to hire individual specialists to handle every unique component. Instead, engineers need to be able to traverse the tech stack as needed and self-learn what they need to know. What's more valuable in this explosion of technology? Someone who knows 2-3 of these boxes in depth, or someone with strong technical acuity (who might only know 1 box) but who can ramp up and make sense of a dozen boxes in a few months?

Preferring technical acuity over specialized knowledge isn't a hard argument to swallow. This is the same argument tech writers have been making about tools for ages. We're all coached to answer job interview questions this way &mdash; "I might not know Tool X, but I know Tools Y and Z, so I'm pretty sure I can pick up Tool X quickly."

## If we believe technical acuity, do we believe in writing acuity?

Strangely, we don't always accept the same arguments about writing. What if a candidate were to say, "Well, I don't know the details around technical writing, but I've written several *plays.*" Or, "I've never done technical writing before, but I was once the *poet laureate of my town!*" Or in reverse, "I haven't done grant writing before, but I've done plenty of technical writing."

{% include random_ad.html %}

If technical acuity would allow for potential competence across technical domains, why shouldn't writing be the same? After all, aren't we addressing a similar rhetorical situation in these other writing domains? Aren't we negotiating our language strategies as we consider audience and purpose? Isn't this "writing acuity"?

We don't care if one is an excellent medical writer, but rather we want to know if they can analyze their audience's information needs, whether they can identify the genre discourse and rules and write within that construct. We want to know if they can anticipate the audience's objections and have a conversation (real or imagined) with the audience in order to drive the content. Understanding of rhetoric is basically writing acuity, which is why tech comm programs teach rhetoric to students.

Sure, someone might have good rhythm in their sentences and a solid grasp of grammar, but that's not necessarily writing acuity, in the same sense that understanding graph packages in Java might not constitute technical acuity.

{% include random_ad.html %}

## "Are you technical?"

This discussion about technical acuity takes me back to one of my first technical writing jobs. The job involved documentation for a network engineering project. The hiring engineer basically wanted to know whether I was "technical." I felt I was pretty technical, though as the weeks on the job went by, I realized that I wasn't as technical as the engineer had hoped. I scrambled to become more technical, as I read books on network engineering in an effort to understand what I needed to document in a multi-million dollar storage array.

His question, "Are you technical?" seems like a good question. But it can be interpreted in so many ways. I tried to remind the engineer that I knew a ton about some technical topics (e.g., WordPress theming, RoboHelp, and more) and that he was being unfair to question whether I was technical or not based on my understanding of RAIDs in storage arrays.

One can be technical even with language or non-code topics. What if I can diagram complex sentences using advanced grammar terminology that labels 16 different elements? Is that technical? What if I can disassemble my bike's crankshaft and then reassemble it with all new parts? How about if I can swap in a new motherboard in my computer? Does being technical in one category really transfer to technical abilities in other categories?

Whether technical acuity allows you to operate across technical domains is an interesting question. For sure, the technical mindset is only the beginning. One has to apply that mindset to study and learning for the subject knowledge needed in that new domain.

## How I'm trying to improve my technical acuity

Overall, I'm persuaded by this argument about technical acuity, so I've decided to be more diligent about completing my "tech pomodoros," as I call them. These are 20-minute sessions where I try to learn some technology. It usually ends up being related to work tech, so lately I've been trying to improve my knowledge of Alexa. (Look for some forthcoming flash briefing skills on my blog, hopefully.)

I made a goal to complete three tech pomodoros the first thing of the day when I come to work. (I consider ramping up my technical acuity a kind of on-the-job training, part of the needed regiment to stay current as a technical writer working in developer docs.) My life seems to get so busy, if I don't knock these pomodoros out first thing, the day's tasks and busy-ness entirely consume me.

We'll see how long I can keep it up, as it does make me less productive at work, but in the long run, I feel it sharpens my mental wheels and makes more capable. It puts me into a learning mindset, which I find useful for the technical writing role. The whole effort reminds me of a common quote from Lincoln, "If I had 8 hours to chop down a tree, I would spend 6 of those hours sharpening my axe."

## Why trends?

Trends are interesting in their own light, but understanding trends on a deeper level becomes essential for the evidence we need in this argument about the need for subject-matter familiarity.

In a rapidly changing field like technology, almost everything is in constant flux. Sometimes you wake up and so much seems to have changed. Consider how some previously dominant companies simply vanished: Blackberry, Blockbuster, Borders Books, Toys 'R' Us, Kodak, Radio Shack, Tower Records, Circuit City, Encyclopedia Britannica, and others.

Some scholars say the reason these companies went bankrupt is that they focused only on what helped make them successful and became blind to further innovation. They also focused too much on the market today rather than the one forming tomorrow (see [Companies That Went Bankrupt From Innovation Lag](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/072115/companies-went-bankrupt-innovation-lag.asp)).

These are companies, of course, not job roles or functions. But I think the same might be same of technical writing professions. Look at the constant evolution of ideas in tech comm discipline. At the turn of the century, we moved from PDF to web formats, then gradually to DITA and the semantic web. There was a time when wikis were rampant, and the idea that everyone could be a tech writer flourished. Then one day wikis (and the myth of crowdsourced docs) died, and YouTube took the spotlight on the Internet. Soon people began saying that all documentation was going to consist of YouTube videos because this is how millennials learn.

Well, videos didn't displace the written format, though they did become much more common, especially from amateurs. In the next turn in the wheel of time, Content Strategy reared its head. Almost overnight, half the tech comm community started calling themselves "content strategists" of one kind or another. Then after a few years, content strategy started to become synonymous with lightweight SEO content farms.

Then chatbots took the center stage. Entire conferences were organized around chatbots and many felt this was the future of documentation. All doc would need to be chunked into soundbites that could be relayed and spoken by chatbots and other voice-integrated devices. Then chatbots sort of lost the spotlight. Now docs-as-code tools seems to be getting the most attention, as tech pubs follows the directions of software engineers in the way they approach docs.

I've left out some trends -- augmented reality, and "Every Page Is Page One," and dynamic personalized content. How do you know whether a trend today will be the norm tomorrow, or whether it will just fizzle out?

We pay attention to trends to ensure that we stay relevant, right? We don't want to wake up one day, perhaps after being laid off and unable to find new work, and ask in a surprised, perplexed way, "What happened?" We want to avoid being caught off guard in becoming professionally unmarketable.

But discerning trends from fads is not an easy task. Understanding whether trends will become the norm requires us to investigate the evidence for the trend. What data supports the idea behind a trend? How can you separate whether a trend is merely some new and shiny tech toy, or whether it's a bona fide direction that the technology landscape has taken? When Blockbuster looked at the emergence of streaming online video, or when Kodak looked at digital photo formats, did they dismiss these trends as fads? How do you know whether to pay attention to trends to to ignore them?

Fortunately, we do have access to evidence. It's staring right in front of our noses.

In the following sections, I'll make the case that one needs some degree of knowledge in order to write content in complex fields (such as developer domains). Without this knowledge, it can be nearly impossible to understand, unravel, and articulate the details of a complex subject. On the other hand, if you're writing UX copy for end-user applications, or providing content for mainstream end users rather than engineers, this more specialized knowledge might not be essential. But for areas of complexity, which is what this series focuses on, you need a deeper understanding. Even so, you'll still probably end up collaborating with engineers on the content. But the degree to which you can participate in the *authoring* &mdash; as opposed to just editing or publishing &mdash; depends on your knowledge of the subject.
