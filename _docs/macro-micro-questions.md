## Questions for letting users switch between macro and micro views

* Can the process be simplified by chunking the information into more granular steps?
* If there are multiple chunks spread out that users have to follow, is there a map that connects the chunks together in a navigable way?
* Would it be appropriate to provide a quick reference guide of the process, as a high-level map of the information terrain?
* Does each chunk connect to the next with a "Next Steps" section?
* What larger process does this task fit into?
* How to facilitate zooming in and out of the process?
* If you were to draw out the process, what would the workflow map look like?
