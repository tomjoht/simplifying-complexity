## Questions for reducing the complexity of technical language

* Are you using the right technical terms?
* Do these technical terms align with the same terms used in other documentation from other companies on the same topic?
* Are the terms defined?
* Is there any background reading users should do to ramp up on the topic?
* Do you use terms consistently or do you include synonyms?
* Could some of the language be made more accessible through tooltips?
* Are you using plain language to reduce the jargon and technical complexity as much as possible?
